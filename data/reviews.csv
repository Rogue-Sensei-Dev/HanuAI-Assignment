Brandon,This laptop is a beast and keeps it cool,"This laptop is so much bigger than my ROG STRIX G16, I was worried about the screen being ips with no hdr, but it looks super good especially at 4k with no light bleed. Running 3d mark scores (ill post the photos) it was well above avg scores and didnt even get over 80°C in fact its avg temp for the benchmark was only 65°C of you wanna game at 2k everything maxed out at over 100fps this is the laptop for you, if you wanna game at 4k mid to high settings this is the laptop for you.",5,2025-05-10
JorgeST,"Big, Beastly, Powerhouse","Gaming has come a long way. In fact, this laptop has better specs than what most desktops would consider top tier only a mere few years ago. I have been using this laptop for a few weeks not and have had nothing but positive experiences. This gaming laptop offers (nearly) every bell and whistle you'd ever want on a laptop. There are countless reasons on why I enjoy this set up but below are my top reasons. Storage - This latop comes with a wopping 2 TB of storage via SSD. As games require more and more storage, ASUS is stepping up their end of the bargain too by offering storage in TB vs GBs. This will give ever gamer plenty of lead way to jam out to their 100 GB + fav game that is on their radar. Speed - With 32 GB of memory and a GeForce RTX 5080, this rig will tear through and need you may have. Again, as mentioned above I recall having 8 GB in an older pc which was upgraded from 4GB. The 32 stock GB of ram will satisfy ever top setting modes for most games out there, and when paired with the 5080... an immersive experience awaits. Design - This laptop is big, heavy but built very sound. Its 18 inch screen towers over most laptops and its LED screen will make any game or movie pop. Its colors are bright and its blur it minimal to none. This laptop will light up any room with its screen. Its weight is said to be about 7.5 lbs which is the polar opposite of other laptops, but with more computing comes more weight. The outputs provided are exactly what you are looking for too with several thunderbold to usb to hdmi to usb c ports to feed your needs. All in all when it comes to gaming, ASUS is stepping up with this line of gaming laptops. They are big, tough and jam packed will of performance. If you are a gamer on the go then consider a laptop vs a desktop with all of the bell and whistles you may be looking for!",5,2025-05-13
JustBeingHonest,Perfect replacement for gaming desktop,"The ASUS ROG Strix is a very functional gaming and multi-use laptop, though at this size, it's really to replace my desktop. I picked the 18 inch version because to fully enjoy gaming, any smaller screen may be too small (unless you value portability more). The screen is beautifully bright and sharp. I really liked that the keyboard's QWERT and ASDF keys are transparent, along with the space bar. The LED lights are a nice ambiance touch and give the feel the laptop is almost floating. You can edit the lighting with the AURA function (F4). It comes with Armoury Crate installed, which enables you to customize cool aura and breathing wallpapers that are synchronized with the laptop's LED lighting. There are two USB A ports on the right and 3 ports on the left (1 USB-A and 2 USB-C). This seems well designed to me because for gaming, you'd want to connect the mouse on the right side and not have a wired mess interfering with it. The trackpad is quite enormous, and I had to disable it for gaming with a mouse because my left hand (lower thumb area) kept accidentally clicking it. While there is plenty of keyboard real estate, the number pad on the right is a bit crammed, as the ""right/end"" key sits just below the #1 key. The numbered keys on the right are also smaller adding to that squeezed in look. That said, I do appreciate them being there for numerical functions. The keys are quiet and not as flat as a normal laptop. They have enough height to where it feels comfortable switching from a mechanical keyboard. The build quality is fine. It's not amazing or terrible, it does the job. The focus here is the GEFORCE RTX 5080 and the large screen anyway, so the build quality isn't an issue to me. Performance-wise, the laptop does well. You can expect the fan to run quite loud when the NVIDIA settings auto select the optimal graphics for your game. When you exit the game, the laptop is quiet as a mouse. The F5 function will also let you quickly select the fan mode (turbo, silent, performance). I was able to run Fornite on maxed out settings with no issue. All the heat blows out the back, and the laptop seems to be efficient at moving air to stay cool. All in all, I'm very satisfied with this laptop as a PC replacement.",5,2025-05-09
ferrari,"The Latest & Greatest packed neatly in an 18"" box","Over time I've had a number of gaming laptops; most recently a previous model of this ROG, and an Alienware M5. To date, each of these have had some performance or design details that were either not included or resulted in poor performance. I've been a reader to the Asus forum many times, and when I had a problem or complaint, I could always count on others with the same concern. So, I'd have to say that in designing this model, Asus has read, studied, and addressed a number of issues that the ROG gamers had presented; the result being this ROG Strix G18. I have to first comment on the presentation - it comes in a unique box that upon lifting the lid, the laptop itself rises up and presents itself to you. I'm surprised they didn't include a voice chip like you'd get in a greeting card that announces itself with a flourish of trumpets - TA-DA! Nice touch, but what else you got!? The machine itself has a nicely sculpted lid with a crisp, clean design. Lid is a little heavy to open, but the dual hinges are solid and swing smoothly. The thin edge bezel also has a solid feel, I've had bezels that actually bend under the stress of opening, not so here. But far & away, the feature I most appreciate is the ""no tool"" back cover. There's a small slider on the underside, slide it open, push the lid up a notch, and the cover is off, revealing all the internals. No need to deal with a half dozen or more tiny screws, you can get your vacuum working in there in less than ten seconds. All the fans (3 of them) are exposed and easily cleaned. I used to dread doing this job on my Alienware, took the better part of an hour or more. This will surely be the cleanest laptop I've ever owned. Thanks, Asus. Can't say I play a variety of games, but do have one I've committed thousands of hours to - the Civilization series - I've owned every one from the beginning, but since Civ 6, and now 7, you can reaglly ratchet up the performance sliders to place high demands on the processing & video power. I would set the framerate & other video specs to half peak values, and that machine would sound like it had emphysema with the fans pouring out heat into the room. This would be my performance test for the G18. I could finally turn the detail sliders up to their max, and enjoy gameplay as the creators intended. The color palette of the screen is gorgeous, I could zoom in to hotspots and enjoy the detail the game artists created. There is one detail I'd like to nitpick with the Asus designers, as I see they are scanning the reviews here. The keyboard lighting. If you're working in the dark, it's pretty near impossible to see the special characters (when shift key is used) - only the numbers light; not the characters above them. Yes, it's a gaming pc, but I do work with it, emailing, etc., and since I'm not a professional typist, I have to use a flashlight to find my ampersands and hashtags. One other reason that draws me to Asus is their online support forum - I've owned Asus products for over 20 years, I would think that the ROG gamer participation is probably one of the beat in the industry. That, and the included Armoury Crate software which offers a myriad of customization & performance settings to improve your experience. These guys are serious about gaming.",5,2025-05-09
Wraith,Closest thing to a full-sized rig that I've owned!,"Ever since I have stopped buying/building full tower gaming rigs, I have gravitated towards those gaming laptops that are a bit sleeker and portable, like the ASUS ROG Zephyrus (which is a fabulous computer in its own right), but this time I wondered if I was doing it all wrong and should have instead been looking at laptops like the Strix. Well, I can safely say that after a week of playing, and testing, and playing some more on the ROG Strix G18, that I WAS wrong and should have been looking here all along. I'm not going to get all bogged down in specs, temperatures, and FPS numbers. There are reviewers out there (and probably here on Best Buy), that do a far more comprehensive job than I ever could. What I will say, is that the G18 is the closest to a full-sized and loaded gaming rig that I've ever owned in a laptop format. BTW, I'm old and have been PC gaming since the Commodore 64! Heck, I remember when my first custom built tower came from Micron computers back in the *cough* 90's, and the awesome new monitor was a 17"" CRT beast! The thing I like the most out of the ASUS ROG Strix G18, is that I don't feel like I'm giving up too much for the portability. Now part of that is because the G18 is NOT as portable as any laptop I've owned before. I remember days of hauling my tower and monitor to a friend's house to set up big gaming LAN parties, and for some reason I've always had in my head that a gaming laptop HAS to be ultimately portable, but that has almost always come at a cost of playability. Plus, as an older gamer, I also don't tend to travel with my gaming gear as much, so I was prioritizing the wrong thing. Hence, the G18 is a great device that I can keep on my shelf and pull out whenever I get the itch to play but not take up a ton of space. I really dig what ASUS has done with their laptop packaging, software, and upgradability with the G18. Opening up the box, you are served up the G18 like the prized possession it is about to be and getting it up and running was the easiest thing I've EVER done with a gaming PC. I started cutting open the box at 0645 on the day after it arrived and I was waking up in the dungeon of Cyrodiil in 'Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion' at 0831. And that is with doing ALL of the updating, from the software, to the BIOS, to cleaning up what very little junk ASUS puts on their systems, to downloading and installing the game from Game Pass Ultimate. The longest part was downloading the game. Easiest time ever with a gaming computer. Also, if you like to tinker a bit with your computers but are no longer in the mood for entire builds or re-builds, the Strix is really nice too. I wanted to add some additional storage space, and it was the easiest thing ever. Flip the laptop over, slide the lever to the left, slide the bottom case toward you, lift up, slot in the SSD, turn the locking knob, and slide the case back on until it locks. Done. Peak efficiency. While it was open I could see that it would be relatively easy for me to tinker with other things if I ever get the itch, but I don't see that happening any time soon. And that's because this thing is a gaming BEAST. I ran Oblivion at the best settings (not max mind you), and the game played like a champ, always staying right around the 60fps target. And it looked beautiful on this screen. I personally believe that the 2/2.5K resolution is the best for gaming. You get beauty without it killing your system. And like I said, the Strix handled it like a pro because one of the other benefits of going with a larger system like this is the better air flow. Even when the Strix was running it's hardest, the fan never got to 'jet engine' levels like I would get with her more svelte cousins. There has only been one little 'meh' thing for me and that hasn't been all that bad, and that is the sound. I was expecting the Strix to be able to push out some bigger and bolder sound, but I didn't find that to be the case. While the sound is perfectly useable, and you even get some decent separation in right and left channels because of its size, it will not on its own blow you away. That's OK, because I tend to play with headphones anyway, and the Strix drives those just fine. All-in-all I'm super stoked with the G18. I found that I have been looking in the wrong place all along for the best combo of capability, size, and portability. It's the first time that I feel that I haven't really given up anything with a laptop over a tower. That's pretty cool.",5,2025-05-10
jago,"Powerful, large and in charge","As a gaming fan, I was super excited to get my hands on the ASUS ROG Strix G18, an 18"" 2.5K 240Hz gaming laptop with Intel’s new (AeroLake) Core Ultra 9 HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 with 16GB of DDR7 RAM, and a large 2TB PCIe SSD. The Eclipse Gray color is sleek and modern looking, but subdued and, this almost goes without saying, is a powerhouse machine and a great desktop replacement that I was looking for. Traveling with this beast is possible but weighing in at over 8 lbs. with the power supply, well, there are better options for that need. Additionally, the ASUS ROG Strix G18 comes equipped with 32GB of DDR5 RAM, offering even faster performance and improved multitasking capabilities and easily handled whatever I threw at it. This model runs on Windows 11 home, which provides a smooth and modern user interface. However, I wish it came with Windows 11 Pro instead, as the professional version offers more features and customization options. One of the first things that caught my eye was the amazing 2.5K (2560x1600) display with a 240Hz refresh rate that is G-SYNC compatible. We gamers know how important smooth and vibrant visuals are, and this laptop totally delivers some impressive eye candy indeed. The colors pop, and my games run smoothly, even in the most intense moments. The 18"" anti-glare screen size is very large, bright (500 nits advertised) and very vibrant as I mentioned before. The performance on the ROG Strix G18 is seriously impressive. The Intel Core Ultra 9 HX processor, paired with 32GB of DDR5 RAM, makes multitasking and running heavy applications a breeze. I can switch between gaming, streaming, and other tasks without any lag. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card is top-notch, and when I play COD Black Ops 6, it can sustain a Frame Rate of over 120 and the graphics card temperature hangs around 71 degrees C, that is with the Graphics settings set to Ultra in the game and a resolution of 3440x1440. When I step that up to the highest setting to Extreme, it dips just a bit to around 110. Very smooth performance with out any issues or hiccups, and the GPU temperature stays in the acceptable range in my opinion. I tested with the 3D Mark Time spy and it scored a 20526 high score. Storage is usually something I worry about, but the 2TB SSD has more than enough space for all my games, media, and files. The fast read and write speeds mean minimal loading times, so I can jump into my games quicker and stay productive with the tasks that I have to accomplish. The laptop's Eclipse Gray finish looks sleek and professional when you turn off the RGB options using the “stealth mode option”, this will turn off the RGB Aura light bar which surrounds the base of the laptop that gives it the appearance of floating on your desk, and also the keyboard RGBs. The main chassis is mostly plastic, and the lid is made of aluminum and allows for a little flex, but despite that it still feels solid overall. Asus has come up with a great toolless access system to the underside of the laptop that allows for easy upgrades to the RAM and SSD among other components. You simply slide the rubberized lever and pull towards you to lift it off. Easy as can be! The laptop also includes multiple ports, which is great for connecting all of my peripherals. It has two thunderbolt USB Type-C, 3 USB Type-A, HDMI 2.1, and a 2.5G Ethernet port, audio jack, and power input, giving me plenty of options for connecting my gaming accessories and other devices. The only drawback is that it doesn’t have a SD/MicroSD card slot built in, but that is not a deal breaker for me. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, great tactile feedback and solid travel for the buttons and has customizable RGB backlighting, and the Q/W/E/R/A/S/D/F and spacebar keys are see-through which adds a cool gaming vibe. The massive trackpad is also a pleasure to use as well with a nice solid clicking feel. One downside is the weight. At around 8.5 pounds, it’s not the most portable laptop, but the power and performance it provides are worth it. The battery life is decent but not amazing, which is expected with such powerful hardware. I usually have it plugged in while gaming anyway, so it's not a big deal. Another downside is the very average 2MP camera that is built in. Not the best quality, and it would have been nice to see a much higher resolution camera for this price. Overall, the ASUS ROG Strix G18 is an incredible gaming laptop that offers top-notch performance, stunning visuals, and plenty of storage. It handles everything I throw at it with ease and provides an immersive gaming experience. If you're looking for a high-end gaming laptop that can tackle the latest games, replace your desktop, and more the ROG Strix G18 is definitely worth checking out and if you register your device with ASUS, you will get a complimentary year of accidental damage as well which is just icing on the cake.",4,2025-05-12
gadgeTT,Portable Upgradable Power,"This ASUS ROG Strix laptop is a BEAST! It has the power to handle just about any game you throw at it while still being portable. The roomy gaming-inspired keyboard and beautiful 18” 2.5K 240Hz screen makes remote gameplay immersive and fluid. When it’s time to upgrade the already powerful components like the memory or storage, you just pop open the bottom cover, no tools needed. Highlights: * Impressive unboxing experience. * Sleek and attractive design. * 380W power adapter! * Relatively slim for a laptop with an 18” screen. * Bright and fluid 18” 2560x1600 screen. * Easy-access tool-less bottom cover for upgrades. * Easy to replace RAM, Storage or Battery. * Massive cooling that is quiet even at higher speeds. * Full keyboard with special hotkeys and numeric keypad. * Fun but classy RGB keyboard and underside lighting. * Tons of ports; RF-45 Ethernet, HDMI, USB-C, USB-A, Headphones * Built-in Webcam and Microphones. Room for Improvement: * Huge power adapter with a proprietary connector to the laptop. * Single power port on the left side of the notebook. Setup: This thing is impressive even before you even set it up or power it on. Open the box and the laptop is presented like a jewel. As the lid to the box is opened, the laptop rises on an elevated platform - presenting you with your prize. The inside of the lid has illustrations that highlight some of the cool features of this laptop and are almost framable. There’s not much in the box - just the laptop, the substantial power adapter and the removable power cord. A few small pieces of paper are there but don’t have much you need. Once you remove this laptop from the box, the rest is straightforward. Plug the huge power adapter into the wall and the port on the left side of the laptop and start going through Windows setup. Once done, you’re greeting with your new gaming beast. Note that the special power port is only on the left side of the notebook. Usage: I’ve been using this laptop for a little while now, and it’s honestly one of the better gaming laptops I’ve come across. Right out of the box, it feels solid and well-built—definitely not flimsy. It’s a bit on the heavier side, but that’s expected with the kind of hardware it’s packing. Performance-wise, it handles everything I’ve thrown at it. Whether it's newer AAA games, some video editing, or running multiple apps at once, it doesn't lag or stutter. The combination of a high-end Intel processor and an RTX graphics card really shows when you’re pushing it hard. Games run smoothly even on high settings, and the high-refresh-rate screen makes everything look super fluid—great if you're into fast-paced titles. The display itself is surprisingly good. Colors are sharp, brightness is decent even during the day, and it's just a pleasure to use for both gaming and general stuff like watching videos or editing photos. The roomy keyboard feels nice too—responsive with good travel—and there's customizable RGB lighting if you’re into that. I’ve also been using it to run local language models with Ollama, and it performs better than I expected. Models like LLaMA 3 or Mistral load up fast and respond quickly, especially with GPU acceleration enabled. The 32GB of RAM helps a lot, and the RTX 5080 GPU cuts inference times significantly. If you're into local AI workflows, this laptop can absolutely handle it without needing cloud compute. It’s great for experimentation, coding assistance, or even running small private chatbots. It does get a little loud when it's working hard, especially when gaming or rendering, but the cooling system keeps the temperatures in check. You’ll hear the fans, but they’re doing their job. I wouldn’t say it runs hot, just audible under load. Battery life is about what you'd expect for a gaming laptop. It’ll get you through a few hours of light use—web browsing, writing, maybe some Netflix—but once you start gaming or doing heavier tasks, you’ll want to keep it plugged in. The huge adapter has plenty of power to keep the laptop running under full load, but it does add a bit of heft to your travel bag. One thing I appreciate is that it comes with a good range of ports—USB-C, HDMI, Ethernet, the usuals—so I never felt like I needed a dongle or hub. And the Wi-Fi is fast and stable, which makes a difference in online games and large file downloads. The RGB keyboard is a bit gimmicky. The see-through keycaps are not uniform so you get light and dark areas. The trackpad is large and a trackpad, either you love them or hate them. Overall: This laptop is intended to be an all-in-one gaming beast that you can either set up on a table with limited space or take with you anywhere inspiration hits. It has more than enough guts to speed through just about any task you throw at it. When the time comes to increase the memory or storage, the tool-less bottom cover pops off without feeling like you’re voiding a warranty or breaking anything. A huge, fluid screen, all the ports you need, power to spare, easy upgradability - all in a slim and portable chassis!",5,2025-05-11
enem156,Monster specs and monster game play,"Gaming machines come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and whether you prefer a stationary desktop setup, or a more portable approach that you can bring to a friends house, they all come down to the same individual pieces that collectively, determine the strength of your game system. Unfortunately there is a huge trade off between quality and affordability that generally determines what system you'll ultimately be playing on. The ASUS ROG Strix line can be configured with a variety of options that can lower or raise the price and performance. My review is based on this machine model as it is sold by ASUS. The ASUS ROG Strix G18 is without question a machine on the quality side of that equation. But if you're a serious gamer who loves the portability aspect of gaming machines (or you happen to not care how much money a great machine costs), this is definitely one to consider. I find that most gaming PCs do, at some point, start pulling their punches when it comes to putting together a consumer rig. Usually skimping on things like the amount of memory, the quality of the display and graphics card and even the CPU. For those who don't know, and may find the machine name confusing, ROG is what ASUS refers to as Republic of Gamers. These is a high quality gaming machine line. The Strix refers to a type of owl, and its qualities, which is why the logo is an owl's eye. Build, look and feel ASUS has packed a ton of great features into this machine and they have done so from the ground, up. The entire build is based on a solid frame and even though some might whine that it's not made of solid titanium, the look and feel is a beautiful dark gray color that doesn't seem to show a lot of fingerprints. The deck slopes towards you slightly and all the corners are gracefully rounded. All the exhaust venting, points out the back, which is really a big plus to me. I have several other laptops that vent out the right side (right where you hand naturally works the mouse), which is insanely annoying. Venting out the back keeps all the hot air (which is considerable thanks to the great cooling system that's been implemented) away from the user. The entire rear edge is used as exhaust and has a really cool “grill” type look to it. Overall, it's a sleek and pleasantly minimalist design. The display hinges are unique and solid offering the right amount of resistance. This is a machine that tops out at just over 7 lbs., so it has a very solid feel to it. Generally, people always seem to balk at a heavier laptop but they don't seem to realize that a lighter machine is going to have more of a flimsy feel and less internal support. If you ever wanted to max out the RAM on your laptop or add more drive space, you will totally appreciate this machine when you flip it over. Releasing a small latch at the front and pulling forward on the bottom panel, allows the entire panel to be removed, giving you a view of the internals of the machine. Now you have direct access to the RAM, but that's not all. There are also two M.2 slots as well that are directly accessed (one is filled with the 2TB drive, but the other is empty). It appears that the battery may also be accessible. I didn't try to remove it, but it looks like that would be possible. The bottom panel is as easy to put back on as it is to remove. This is a really nice feature, and will be appreciated by anyone who has ever tried to update their laptop and been frustrated by the lack of access they usually have. Features Anyone looking for a high end gaming laptop is able to look up the long list of features and specs for themselves, so I don't want to waste a lot of time here (I mean the list literally goes on and on), but I need to at least highlight what I consider to be the stand out components. All these components combine to eek out as much speed and performance as possible. Intel Core Ultra 9 processor NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 graphics processor 32GB of DDR5 memory 2TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 SSD 3 individual processors (Intel Ultra 9, NVIDIA 5080 and Intel NPU for AI) 18” IPS, LED display, 240Hz, 2560 x 1600 resolution monitor with anti glare screen Fantastic cooling and heat exhaust system I could certainly go on, but you should, by now have the impression that this is a machine that will handle (with ease) any current game you care to throw at it. If I could sum it up, it's fast, smooth and insanely competent. Playing Doom Eternal is just a pleasure. This is the first machine I've played that game on where the machine speed can actually go much faster than the user can. This is not to say other machines can't handle the game properly, it just seems that this machine has horsepower to spare and will go as fast as you could possibly need it to. Keyboard and lighting effects The keyboard is laid out well, with the inclusion of a full set of number keys along with the standard dual use function keys. There is also a great set of five keys dedicated to volume up and down, microphone off/on, fan mode (which allows you to cycle through different fan speeds on the fly), and a key to directly open up the Armoury Crate program. While these five keys have specific icons on them, you can configure them for different options if the standard ones aren't to your liking. There's also a dedicated and easily identified power button, along with an absolutely huge touch pad. I like the feel of the low profile keys. They seem to have a higher resistant action that feels very solid and not mushy. One thing I do wish this very full size keyboard had was more definition and isolation of the arrow keys. It seems they could of done a little better here by making them more obvious. As they are, there is a generous amount of space between the Copilot key and the left arrow key, but the rest of the arrows just flow into the keys next to them without an easy way to feel any definition. Not a big deal, but something that I personally miss. The lighting and effects controls are all customized through the Armoury Crate and Aura Creator programs. Basic lighting controls can be handled through Armouuy Crate (along with other system settings). Aura Creator will allow you to set to different color and effect profiles. This is where you can change the way you would like the the ground effects lighting (Full-Surround AURA) and key zone lighting to look and act. There are four key zones that divide up the keyboard, but unfortunately, this particular model does not allow for per-key assignments. While the dedicated look of the standard gaming keys is nice, I feel that if you want to be able to actually read the keys, it helps to use a darker color as the print on the keys is white. With the huge color palette and effects offerings, this will certainly afford you hours of customization fun. Also, you can save different profiles 'til your heart's content. Usually, in my experience, the selection of color choices seems to be far greater than what the actual LEDs can reproduce, and that is still the case here, but anyone familiar with this type of customization will probably expect that. Display and audio The display is a 2.5K, 16:10 size with a 240Hz refresh rate. It includes features like Dolby Vision (on video playback), Pantone color validation (which is a way of keeping colors true to the Pantone color palette), it's able to use NVIDIA G-SYNC on games, inherently uses blue light filtering and has a matte finish that shows rich and deep colors from any angle without an annoying room reflection. In short, it's a beautiful display experience. The built in sound on this laptop is better than I've heard on most others. It includes virtual Dolby Atmos (5.1.2), from two speakers somehow. I don't know how they do it but I did hear a noticeable difference in the sound quality, over many (if not all) other laptops I've played on. I can only describe the sound as extremely spatial. Sound seems to come from more places than just the speakers. Conclusion Anyone that has a desire to buy a high end gaming laptop with specs out the ceiling, should at least give this machine some consideration. It's components are really outstanding and without question allow you to play any game you want. This will certainly be a good fit for content creators, and photo/video creation and editing. People looking for this quality will have no trouble spending what it takes to get that feature set, and I will say the cost is not for the faint of heart. I like everything about this machine and appreciate all the small touches it includes like the beefy, dedicated power supply (with the owl eye logo as well), but if you don't want to take the supply with you, you can also charge it with a USB-C input. The light colors and effects are great, especially the unique ground effects lighting. The overall look and feel with the curved corners and dark gray finish. The way the keyboard stays nice and cool even though the exhaust is blasting out scalding hot air from intense gaming (truly, this is a really spectacular and underrated achievement). RJ-45 network connection, which in itself is an average inclusion, but this is a 2.5GbE port, so good job there. Any true gamer will thoroughly appreciate the specs, the layout and the fun this machine brings to the table. Exceptional job ASUS!",5,2025-05-09
optimummind,An excellent desktop-replacement gaming laptop,"=== Summary === The 2025 Asus ROG Strix 18 has replaced my MSI Aegis gaming desktop with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X and Radeon 6700XT 12GB, and it did not disappoint as a desktop-replacement do-it-all machine. It provides and does everything I want from a laptop of this class – a powerful CPU and GPU combo for gaming and video editing, fast NVME storage (2TB) with room to add another drive, 32GB of DDR5 memory, a vibrant and fast-refreshing 18” display, a big and responsive touchpad along with a spacious and responsive keyboard with a usable number pad on the side, fast and stable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections without weird connection drop-outs, plenty of USB-A and USB-C ports, and a good and relatively quiet cooling system. For this much coin, one should expect all-around excellence in performance and stability, and the 2025 ROG Strix 18 delivers it. It’s a Win. _________ *Pros: -Powerful components that provide an excellent gaming experience. -Bright, vibrant, and fast-refreshing (250Hz) G-Sync display with even lighting and crisp resolution. -Spacious and responsive touchpad. -Comfortable keyboard with good feedback. -Useful and usable number pad. -Quick-access bottom panel for easy access for upgrades and cleaning. -Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4. -Decent audio speakers. -Plenty of ports. _________ *Neutral: -The 1080P webcam is grainy under low-light conditions. -Can’t open the lid with just one finger. _________ *Cons: -None === Design and Build Quality === The Asus ROG Strix 18 is my third high-end gaming laptop, and its design and build quality have met my expectations for a device at this price point. It’s a dark and handsome machine with great fit-and-finish and solid build materials. Some people may be disappointed that only the lid is made of metal with the rest being plastic, but I don’t mind it since Asus did not utilize the rough, cheap, and grainy kind of plastic but the kind that feels smooth, hard, and durable. The 18” display has relatively slim bezels with excellent brightness, color accuracy, and viewing angles, and with enough room on the top bezel for both a 1080P webcam and an IR module for Windows Hello facial recognition, which I appreciate. The display tech may be IPS but it’s a good one, and I don’t notice a big difference between the 250Hz IPS panel on the ROG Strix 18 and the mini-LED 240Hz panel on my 2024 Acer Predator Helio 18 gaming laptop. As I get older, I appreciate larger displays, and 18” is my favorite display size on a laptop. The keyboard layout is spacious, and the keys feel soft and gentle with good uptake and snappiness. The Microsoft Precision touchpad is also big and spacious, and it’s an absolute pleasure to use. I like that a numpad was included since I use it when doing my finances and calculations. Thanks to the variety of ports offered, I can avoid using any dongles and I love it. I appreciate having three USB-A ports (one on the left, two on the right), two USB-C ports, an ethernet port, an audio jack, and an HDMI port. Gaming laptops usually come with some bling, and the ROG Strix 18 is no different, with a rectangular LED strip on the bottom panel as well as an RGB keyboard with multiple lighting effects. It’s not too over-the-top nor garish – I think Asus provided just the right amount of bling and customization. I absolutely love the tool-free, snap on and snap off design of the bottom panel. It made it so simple and easy when I added another 2TB NVME drive. Even the NVME drive doesn’t require any tools or screws as a plastic lever is used to hold down the drive in its slot (see picture). It’s a brilliant design touch from Asus, and I hope all other manufacturers copy and implement these features. At 7.05 lbs (3.20 kg), the Strix 18 feels heavy, but this is par for the course when it comes to desktop-replacement level gaming laptops, so I won’t knock any points off for that. Just make sure you get a backpack with ample shoulder padding and padded compartments for when traveling with the Strix 18. All in all, the ROG Strix 18 is easy on the eyes, easy on your hands and joints, and it’s a well-designed laptop that is a pleasure to use. === Performance === With a 24-core, 24-thread Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 with 16GB of GDDR7 memory, 32GB of DDR5-5600, and a Micron 2TB NVME PCIe 4.0 hard drive, the ROG Strix 18 is a champion of a laptop that can handle pretty much everything in a fast and performant manner. For a machine such as the Strix 18, my primary usage scenario is playing games followed by video editing, and the Strix 18 was very well-equipped to make me a happy customer. I played a variety of games such as Clair Obscure Expedition 33 (turn-based RPG), Dragon Age the Veilguard (action RPG), Stalker 2 (shooter), Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (action RPG), Cyberpunk 2077 (shooter), The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered (RPG), and Split Fiction (arcade & puzzler), and the Strix 18 handled all of them very well, delivering high and stable frame rates. The latest DLSS and frame generation technology from Nvidia can boost the framerates higher without much detrimental visual artifacts, and I think it’s a game-changer that will only get better with time. The Strix 18 comes with Wi-Fi 7 (latest) and Bluetooth 5.4 (latest), and they provide fast and stable speeds for a smooth and lag-free gaming experience. I currently have a Bluetooth keyboard (Corsair K100 Air Wireless), a gamepad (Corsair SCUF Envision controller), and some noise-cancelling headphones (Bose QuietComfort Ultra) connected to the Strix 18, and with the laptop connected to my 55” TV in the living room, it’s a satisfying and fun gaming experience on par with a traditional gaming desktop system. When it comes to performance, I’m completely content and satisfied, and I expect to use the Strix 18 as my main gaming system for many years to come. === Windows, Apps, and Software Experience === At first boot-up, I was kind of annoyed by how long it took to get Windows 11 set up and ready to go. There were many updates to be downloaded and installed, and the laptop was automatically rebooted several times to finish the installations. I know this is good for me and the machine, but I was feeling a bit impatient because I was so excited by the ROG Strix 18 and wanted to unleash the beast as soon as possible. 😊 Thankfully, BIOS and firmware updates did not take as long. Once all the Windows updates finished and my setting preferences were restored after logging in to Microsoft account, it was smooth sailing afterwards. There is not much bloatware installed, and whatever you don’t want is very easy to uninstall and remove. I only uninstalled one preinstalled app, and it was a video editing software called CapCut from Bytedance due to privacy concerns. There are many preinstalled Asus apps but they are useful and don’t take up much space, so I kept them. The Asus Armoury Crate is a good example of an excellent preinstalled manufacturer app, and it offers several useful customization features, such as quickly togging between various fan modes (Windows, Silent, Performance, Turbo, and Manual), setting RGB lighting effects, creating custom performance profiles for apps (e.g., games vs productivity apps), and creation of macros. Windows 11, compared to Windows 10, still kind of sucks, but I was able to customize it and make it more functional and easier to use by installing the ExplorerPatcher app (by Valinet), which allows for Taskbar and Start Menu customization, among others. Windows 11 has come a long way, and it has been very stable, and I made my peace with it. === Everyday Usage and Livability === The ROG Strix 18 is an easy machine to live with and comfortable to interact with. The big, bright 18” screen is very comfortable on the eyes and excellent for gaming, watching movies, working on spreadsheets, and anything else, really – the bigger the screen, the better, I say. The touchpad is big and very responsive, and the Microsoft Precision touchpad software makes it easy to customize and create your own touch and tap gestures. The keyboard is spaciously laid out and the keys are responsive with good feedback, uptake rate, and organization. I REALLY love that the arrow keys are full-size, and I also appreciate the gaps between the Function keys, which makes quickly finding and tapping on the desired Function key, like the F5 key, much faster and easier to memorize via muscle memory. When I’m not gaming, I set the operating mode to Silent via the Armoury Crate app, and the Strix 18 becomes either completely silent or whisper quiet while still offering enough power for non-demanding workloads such as office productivity apps, web browsing, and streaming movies and music. For gaming, I press the M4 keyboard button to switch over to the Turbo mode for maximum performance and frames. Doing so does increase the fan noise quite a bit but if you wear headphones or turn up the volume on the soundbar, then it’s a non-issue. For a big and heavy 18” gaming laptop, the Strix 18 is surprisingly easy and comfortable to live with, and I have no trouble recommending it as a desktop-replacement machine. === Is it worth the coin? === I absolutely think so. For this price, you’re getting top-notch CPU, GPU, HDD, and memory components, as well as a high refresh rate display that is vibrant and color accurate. The touchpad and keyboard are spacious and comfortable, and with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4, it’s pretty future-proof. Upgrades and maintenance are dead-simple thanks to the tool-free bottom panel that easily pops off. The ROG Strix 18 will remain performant and relevant for many years due to its powerful components, and it’s definitely worth the high cost of entry price. It’s a Win, and I give it 5 Stars.",5,2025-05-09
clow18,"Fantastic Performance, Excellent Thermals!","The ROG strikes G 18 2025, 5080 is it extremely well built gaming machine. The RGB lights at the bottom of the laptop are a very cool feature that I did not know I needed. I’m used to seeing RGB on laptops, but having it go fully around the laptop adds a ton more flare and it looks amazing. Stellar feature. The lid is metal and well built.Everything else is plastic, which isn’t a problem for me. It does have an HDMI 2.1 port that is connected to the dedicated GPU, which is nice. As for airflow, which was nice to see that they adjusted this, the vent ventilation is on the back as opposed to the sides so you don’t get your hand burned while gaming. Gaming wise, whatever I was playing, I was about to stay well above 80 fps on average. Temps stayed cool from what I can see and never did I the keyboard feel to hot to use (which is a huge plus for longer sessions). I really cool feature I loved was the toolless back removal. While it seems simple, I do not dread removing the back like I have with other machines that require tools and for you too keep with the very small screws. Huge plus. Overall, this is the complete package when it comes to gaming laptops. Performance, excellent thermals, all with a large 18in screen. Asus killed it with this one.",5,2025-05-12
veritech13,AMAZING LAPTOP. DESIGN/PERFORMANCE- 5080 BEAST!,"I was blown away by this gaming laptop, the design, size and performance is amazing- exceeds all expectations. It has numerous features and ease of access to upgrade RAM/SSD make this a must have gaming PC. I will focus on the gaming aspect as that is it's designed purpose. FIRST OFF, It looks amazing- the screen size 18"" 2.5K 240Hz Nebula Display looks amazing. The brightness, refresh rate and color pops- the graphics look great while gaming or watching movies- the other use I have for it. The refresh rate is pretty standard in gaming laptops, no blur, smooth motion without any lag. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 Laptop GPU- Beast of a video card- the Nvidia App also lets you run auto-tune for better performance. The Design of the laptop allows for the air circulation to come in thru the underneath and exhaust all the hot air thru the rear of the laptop. The fan does get a little noisy but when i am gaming the volume is up or i have head phones on so it not an issue for me. It has blazing 32GB DDR5, the 2 slots are used so you can't add memory without replacing the installed sticks. It does have spare SSD slot if you want to add storage, I am adding a SSD for dedicated gaming drive. The bottom panel has a manual switch/lever which allows you to remove the panel without tools. The SSD can be removed with a manual Q-Latch, no tools needed. It is a very nice and simple design. The Keyboard has a very satisfying feel, the travel and click makes for a very responsive and spaced out keys. You don't feel like the keys are jammed together. The trackpad, is a decent size , i don't use it much but it looks good. The aura RGB is nice, bright and adjustable...I am not huge fan so I turn it off. The speakers are very loud, it was surprising how nice the bass sounds and how clear the sound it at the upper volume levels. The IR camera is a nice bonus because it allows for Microsoft Hello login feature, makes it pretty seamless to just boot up the pc and have bypass the lockscreen. I downloaded Battlefield 2042 and Skyrim, i have an xbox style controller connected via bluetooth and the screensize, color quality, refresh rate and GPU make this a top tier gaming PC. Battlefield -OPTIMIZED Settings gave me an average of 122fps, and the GPU temp hovered at about 72 degrees...the fan was pretty much going non-stop and it was fairly loud but like i mentioned earlier I play my games with the sound pretty high. The performance of the has left nothing to be desired, so far no complaints but there are some things to aware of...the power adapter is a brick, it's heavy and big. The laptop itself is very heavy and not really meant for use on the go..as in using it on a plane/uber...its pretty big but well worth it.",5,2025-05-09
couponkingofjax,The Best of the Best!!,"Usually whenever you think about upgrading your PC you always want the best of the best. “I wish my new computer could be the ultimate gaming machine with the best graphics card a big, beautiful screen, a high-end processor that will handle anything I throw at it and oh, it wouldn’t hurt if it was easy to upgrade too.” Well luckily for you the new ASUS ROG Strix G18 is the exact computer you’re looking for, and no this is not an Obi Wan Kenobi mind trick. Initial unboxing of an ROG product is always an enjoyable experience and the G18 is no exception. The theme of the box has the feel of a high-performance car and upon opening you’re greeted with a stencil highlighting some of the aspects of the design of the laptop. Holding the laptop for the first time it’s evident this model isn’t made to be super portable clocking in at 7.5 pounds. But nonetheless it’s a beautiful piece of machinery. Booting it up for the first time and seeing the RGB lights shimmer rainbow colors on my glass desk was an awesome experience. Whoever thought of putting a light bar around the bottom of the laptop should get a raise. Really cool feature that I never knew I needed! The keyboard immediately stands out as well. You’re either going to love it or hate it, but the Q,W,E,R,A,S,D,F and Space bar are all translucent style keys that are affected more by the Aura gaming lighting than the other keys. The keyboard is full-sized with keys that feel soft but responsive. There are additional hot keys for gaming as well. You can’t help but notice how big, bright (500 nits) and beautiful the screen is on this laptop. I’ve owned a lot of different gaming laptops, and this is the nicest I’ve probably ever seen. ASUS has spared no expense with this computer, throwing the literal gambit of high-end parts that any gamer would be looking for. The Ultra 9 275HX is an absolute beast of a processor. The RTX 5080 can handle any game at max setting. There are 32 gigs of ram and a 2TB SSD. It should also be noted this laptop has a super cool way of upgrading the ram and HD’s with a latch system underneath that allows easy access in seconds! The cooling on this laptop is another standout feature with the ROG intelligent cooling. Their designs allow the laptop to run cooler and quieter and it’s noticeable when pushing the laptop during gaming. It’s probably one of the quietest high-performance laptops I’ve ever tested. The laptop comes with a slew of different ports; 2 Thunderbolt 5 USB-C, 3 USB-A, HDMI 2.1 a 2.5g ethernet port or WIFI 7 to choose from. The speakers on the laptop are impressive with a Dolby Atmos quad speaker setup. I’ve been playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 nonstop and the music sounds gorgeous. The laptop comes with Windows 11 Home and utilizes Copilot which is something I’ve grown to use quite a bit. Xbox game pass is the best deal in town and gets you access to so many great games and luckily the computer comes with a 3 month trial to test it out! After putting this computer through the ringer and playing countless hours of gaming, I could be happier with the results. The ASUS ROG Strix G18 is a powerhouse laptop that suits anyone’s needs whether you’re a gamer, professional editor or creator/streamer. The RGB lighting along the bottom makes this laptop a head turner. If you’re looking for a top-of-the-line laptop you can’t go wrong with this model. It’s without a shadow of a doubt the best gaming laptop I’ve ever owned.",5,2025-05-09
blah,"Great specs, and very good performance.","Great specs, and very good performance. Build / Screen: While the build is not terrible by any means, it’s mostly plastic with exception of the lid/back of the display). I personally like the way it looks overall, especially that the back looks a bit more like the Asus ROG Zephyrus line of laptops. It has a really cool LED strip all around the bottom, which looks really nice in a dark room, and it can be customized so you can shut it all off. The hinges on the screen are for me the most critical in the build quality and thankfully this seems to be very sturdy. While I am not totally in love with the plastic parts on the laptop, at least it doesn’t pick up fingerprints on it as much as you would think. I don’t notice them much where I touch the body. This is an 18” screen, but keep in mind this is only an 8-bit panel. My unit didn’t have much backlight bleed. It had some, however it was very minimal, as is the case with virtually all LED IPS screens that are not OLED, and it does get pretty bright for me, but I wish the contrast were a lot more given the cost of this machine. Granted, those are also 16” screens and not 18”. I have this laptop generally set up with a large OLED screen for playing games, and it is great on that screen, and you can still push the resolution to 2.5k and not full 4K to save on performance. I do really wish it had at least a micro-LED screen or at least a 10-bit panel for better color display handling for times when I do want to play directly on the laptop display itself. What the display does do very well is provide a great sweet spot for a laptop screen of this size, 2560 x 1600, and a 240hz screen (which comes in very handy as this video card can do “Frame Generation” - more on that later. Keyboard and trackpad The keyboard is pretty good, it feels pretty nice to type on, very little flex on the front. However I personally do not care so much for the transparent “ghost” keys on the ‘QWER ASDF’ and space bar. It is very subjective I know, but I truly would have preferred the same key caps like the rest of the keyboard. You also get a full sized keyboard layout, with a num pad! This is great for me, as I use 3D software where this is critical for me and my workflow, with so many shortcuts for different software I use tied to a NUM pad specifically. The RGB lighting can all be controlled inside the Armory Crate software. Armory Crate will also let you customize the light bar that runs all along the bottom of the laptop too, including turning it all off. I really like the trackpad, I don’t think it is glass, but it is pretty big and responsive to left and right clicks. Upgrading - this is crazy how easy it is. A new introduction to the world of laptops is how easy it is to access the internals. Just shut the laptop off, close the screen lid and flip it over. You need ZERO tools! There is a latch, and you can then just take the bottom cover off, where you have access to the SSD slots, there are two, and one is already populated. The other will take a standard 2280 SSD. You also have access to the 2 RAM slots where you can pull the two sticks out and upgrade to more than the included 32GB of RAM size. While most other gaming laptops aren’t that hard to upgrade depending on the model, there is always a bit of a risk with disconnecting the battery from the motherboard, and things that can be a little tricky for some people to do. The latch system seems to actually block the battery power once it is removed so you can’t short anything out on the system (the reason you need to disconnect the battery when upgrading other laptops). Processor - plenty fast - even for content creation The processor is really great on this machine, it is an Intel Ultra 9 275HX, and chewed through a whole bunch of apps I threw at it. Luckily, what does seem to be a whole lot better with this G18 laptop is power efficiency compared to last generation intel chips. It seems to run faster while draining less power, which is good, as it means you can divert more of that power to the GPU. It is definitely faster than my previous laptop, however it is not leaps and bounds faster. GPU - RTX 5080 laptop GPU - this laptop can run this GPU up to 175 watts the max amount NVIDIA will let manufacturers go in a laptop. This is the meat and potatoes for most games, and yes, it runs most games I have tried great. Nvidia finally got most of their driver issues with all the new RTX 5080 series in the last week and half of me writing this, and I had no issues after that last driver update so far. The great thing with having a “larger” sized laptop, is that Asus is able to throw more wattage to both the GPU/CPU because there is more room for cooling in laptops of this size. Of course that comes at the cost of having something that isn’t quite as portable, but I think if you are buying an 18 inch laptop, you mostly are going to have it in one place most of the time. Now here is the thing with this laptop's GPU. While it is really good for a full powered laptop GPU @ 175watts, it isn’t leaps and bounds over my RTX 4080 laptop that also ran at full wattage in 2023. At least that is, not until you turn on some of the new features the RTX 5080 can do that the 4080 could not, and that is frame generation! Yes, it works! On Cyberpunk 2077 with their latest patch and the newest NVIDIA drivers, it definitely looks great, but cranking it up too far, and it introduces a bit too much latency for me. I was a bit on the fence about frame generation, but it really does help, as long as you don’t over-crank settings. You want to at least get your game running at 40-50fps so it has a decent frame rate to begin with so that the DLSS and Frame Generation can have a good source to work from. And the screen is G-Sync compatible, so if your frame rates in games vary up and down you will not get screen tearing, which is a great thing to have on the display. Speakers They sound pretty good for a laptop, but if you are gaming, you are going to want to use headphones, as the fans get loud under heavy load. In fact, I am glad those fans kick in that loud, it keeps your system running cool. That is the price you kind of have to pay for having a system with this much wattage and performance, it needs to be cooled off. Portability Look, this is a big and fairly heavy laptop. It is 18” and it is pretty heavy, especially if you have to carry the charger with you. However if you don’t need it to carry around everyday, and just need to move it around your home you will be good. I would even be ok with taking it here and there on occasion, just not daily. This is not the kind of laptop you want to have on your back everyday. Overall This is a great spec laptop if you need this large of a screen. My only issue with it is that for the asking price I wish it had a better quality display with at least a 10 bit display panel. Luckily it is 240hz and G-Sync compatible. I am only not giving it a full five star rating because of the display. Otherwise, this is a nearly perfect machine, especially if you are coming from any gaming laptop older than 2 years ago, the RTX 30XX based NVIDIA series GPUs, this will be a MAJOR upgrade.",4,2025-05-10
Jacbo14,A Portable Gaming Powerhouse,"A Portable Gaming Powerhouse PROS + Blazing fast gaming performance + Solid battery life when not gaming with smart GPU switching + Great cooling, especially by gaming laptop standards (e.g. won’t burn you to touch laptop deck while gaming) + 240hz high-refresh rate screen has great motion resolution + 5080 laptop GPU is full wattage version (175w) & supports all of the latest Nvidia DLSS features, which work amazingly well in games which support them + Great I/O selection, including two thunderbolt 5 ports + Tool-free entry to internals is amazing if trying to access things like SSD storage + Great use of RGB under the laptop & keyboard (as someone who doesn’t like overly gamer looking laptops) + Solid (& heavy) build quality and materials, with very minimal screen flex and strong hinge for lid CONS - Fans can get quite loud as heat & fan speed increases (I recommend staying away from Turbo mode unless you have a good pair of noise cancelling headphones) - Chassis is a bit of a fingerprint/grease magnet SO-SO * Keyboard keys are serviceable, but not the best laptop keyboard I have used for long typing sessions. Works well for gaming though * Screen picture quality is fine, but far from the best I have seen on a laptop from a contrast and color perspective. For this much expense, it would have been nice to have a more vivid screen. Great viewing angles though if that matters for you. * There is no getting around the fact that this is an expensive device. You get what you pay for though THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT UNBOXING The Asus ROG Strix G18 is a beast, both physically and from a gaming perspective. Normally I don’t pay much attention to packaging (I unbox everything and don’t really remember it the moment it's gone), but this laptop sets the stage right from the start with the most unique unboxing of a laptop I have had. It comes in this cardboard box, which when opened, has a mechanism that lifts the laptop up on a small cardboard platform as the box lid is raised, like it is presenting the laptop to you. Above the platformed laptop on the lid is a graphic design showcasing everything the laptop has to offer from a hardware perspective. It’s a small touch, and has nothing to do with the laptop itself, but is without a doubt impressionable and sets a great first impression for the device. When a laptop costs a premium, it helps when the unboxing experience feels above and beyond. FIRST IMPRESSIONS & SET-UP From a hardware & I/O perspective, you get a lot here. To start, because this isn’t trying to be a thin and light laptop, you get the benefit of a lot more I/O than a lot of modern laptops. Specifically, you get a 3.5mm headphone jack, 2.5G ethernet port, 3x USB-A 3.2 ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, and 2x Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, along with a power input port for the custom Asus Power Adapter (it can charge as a slower rate over USB-C as well). The dual thunderbolt 5 ports are a particular benefit for me here, given how rare they still are on modern PCs and how much bandwidth (80Gbps bi-directional or 120 Gbps uni-directional), they offer compared to Thunderbolt 4. This can be used to power higher resolution/refresh rate displays, but could also help future proof the laptop a bit when thunderbolt 5 based eGPUs become more common. On the build quality side, it feels quite premium, with a mostly metal and hard plastic chassis. The screen hinge in particular is something that stood out to me, it feels very strong and actually doesn’t let you open the screen one-handed (which is surprising given how heavy the base is), since it actually lifts the base with it. There is very minimal screen flex, and the screen itself looks pretty good. Asus calls it the “Nebula Display”, which can display 500 nits of peak brightness and 100% DCI-P3 color gamut. It also comes with an anti-glare coating which is almost matte looking. The result is a display that gets plenty bright, has good viewing angles, and combats reflections quite well. Combined with the 240hz refresh rate it feels very snappy for gaming. Where I think the display falls short for me is in the contrast, as it still feels like an IPS display. Coming from using OLED and mini-LED displays, it is a far cry from that level of picture quality, and while you can still go up in trims to get a SCAR model with the nicer display, it would have been nice if this more “base” G18 model had a bit nicer of a display from a contrast perspective. Again, it’s not bad at all, but for my standards, I think it is “acceptable”, which on a premium gaming laptop, can be more or less acceptable depending on your preferences. I tend to use external monitors already for 90% of my gaming, so it isn’t a big issue for me. I also want to mention two other quick hardware things that I think are nice touches. The first is the RGB, which I think is nicely done using a lightbar that runs the full perimeter of the bottom of the laptop, and reflects on the tabletop (as well as doubles as the light for the keyboard backlight). It's not too showy, but gives a nice flair to the laptop that is totally unique. The second thing I really liked is that the laptop features this Q-latch system which allows you to open the bottom of the laptop quickly without any screws. It's so much nicer than dealing with tiny screws you might lose, and it makes it easier if you are trying to clean the laptop, add additional storage, or for maintenance. It's a small touch, but very nicely implemented. On the software side, if you have ever set-up any PC with Windows, then you know what the set-up process for this device is like, so I won’t go into too many details here. What I will say is that the webcam works quite well with Windows Hello, and you do have a fair amount of Asus software pre-installed that you need to configure. I am generally not a fan of pre-installed bloatware, but I do think Asus does it better than most, with MyAsus being the general device software for managing system settings/updates, and Armory Crate being the gaming center for things like performance mode tuning, RBG, game library, and more. I am generally a fan of Armory Crate, although it can be a bit laggy at points, but it is far from unusable and keeps things simple. Apart from this, there was minimal additional software pre-loaded, and you can configure your additional gaming software (Steam, Epic, Razer, etc.), to your liking. GAMING EXPERIENCE What matters more than anything, when investing in a gaming laptop, is how it performs playing games, and thankfully this is where the Strix G18 exceeded my expectations. With a laptop 5080 (at the full 175W TGP), and an Intel Ultra 9, you are getting some of the best mobile hardware you can get for gaming, but where this tends to fall apart for me with gaming laptops is heat & noise. I am happy to say though that I think Asus has done a great job with cooling. It has a tri-fan design and a vapor chamber design that extends all throughout the laptop, with a fairly thick heatsink. Heat is vented out the back which keeps the keyboard deck from getting too hot. I played the laptop via wall power in the Performance power profile, and found that the GPU was surprisingly staying around 70C when gaming and while the CPU was getting warmer near 85-90C, it never tended to exceed that mark too far in my longer gaming sessions. What was more surprising though was that while the fans can get quite audible in performance mode, I didn’t find them unbearable. I would of course recommend using headphones, but the fans didn’t need to be full blast to achieve acceptable heat. I would say to stay away from Turbo mode though, which is the exception to this rule for me. In my benchmarks I found that you get at most around 5-6% more FPS, but at the cost of full fan-speed and heat which to me doesn’t feel worth it. In terms of performance benchmarks, I ran several games, including Cyberpunk 2077, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, The Quarry, & a few more games. Across the board gaming was great to exceptional. In games which support all of the latest Nvidia features, like Cyberpunk & Indiana Jones, it can perform its best. DLSS multi-frame gen is almost like magic with how well it increases the fluidness of motion without introducing much additional latency. I tend to play using a TV with a controller typically, and in these cases I couldn’t tell any difference in latency, but the visual fluidity was massively improved with minimal to no noticeable artifacts. Coming from a laptop with a 4080, the typical performance in games without DLSS features, like the Quarry, wasn’t as huge of a difference. However, in games which support these features, it really makes the experience much better. For example, with every setting maxed (including path tracing) in Cyberpunk 2077, I was able to regularly get 80-100fps (~40-45 fps before frame gen) using multi-frame gen. While a laptop will never be able to scale to the heights of a desktop in terms of raw gaming performance, this really does feel like a desktop replacement, with AAA quality performance, top-end features, and great cooling, while also still being portable. Definitely the best gaming mobile gaming experience I have had to date. CONCLUSION The G18 has so many things it does right. The hardware looks and feels top-notch, cooling is great by laptop standards, I/O is full-featured, gaming performance is excellent, and it does it all well. Yes, I think the software could be a bit better (but you can only do so much with Windows), the screen contrast could be better at this price point, and at full power the fans can get very loud. But all of these cons feel negligible for me in the face of all of the pros. You get a gaming laptop to game, and this is where the G18 is at its best. If you are in the market for a high-end gaming laptop and don’t have size constraints, I think this is an excellent choice.",5,2025-05-11
Skyboxer,Worth the $ If you want a GREAT gaming Laptop,"After setting up my laptop and letting it charge for roughly two hours, I started to get into what this thing could do. The unboxing was like the previous Asus laptop I got. As soon as you open up the lid, the laptop pops up for easy access to that, as well as the power brick and documentation. As usual with my gaming laptops, I install a few games, then get some readings, to see where we are at the “new” stage. Before all that, I wanted to talk about the ease of cracking into the internals. Whether to change batter or whatever, ASUS has made the access unbelievably easy with their tool-less access. They really shine with that move. I have already installed a second SSD drive, and it took less than 5 minutes. They don’t have a screw to hold down the SSD but rather a little quick release knob. Internally, Asus has what they are calling “intelligent cooling”, which they claim will keep the CPU 15 degrees cooler. As far as the keyboard the main thing I must have is a number pad, which this has due to the full-size keyboard. That really is one of the things I really make sure it includes. Gaming so far has been awesome. The fans are not loud, but you do hear (unless wearing headphones) them speed up when they need to. I'll attach some pics you can see the numbers from Windows and in game counter.",5,2025-05-08
dustinw,Incredible performance and nice form factor,"Asus has been doing so well lately with their hardware choices, and the ROG Strix G18 is no exception. It includes some of the absolute best performance components you could as for in a gaming laptop, and still manages to be reasonably compact, especially for an 18"" laptop. - Hardware/Design The laptop itself, while maybe a bit thicker than other modern laptops, but doesn't feel cumbersome or too heavy. It feels like a higher-end device where many considerations were made to deliver the best end result. My favorite of which, being the toolless access to upgrade the laptop by simply hitting the release and opening the entire bottom of the laptop to swap out components. Very, very cool. While the 32GB of RAM is excellent, I may upgrade this, just because it is so easy to do. Slotting in an additional 32GB of RAM in the unused slot is an easy upgrade. The 2TB SSD is also excellent, but with the option to upgrade it down the road, it's something to consider too. I also really like the way the lighting can be subtle and reactive with what you're doing. Whether it's reacting to performance or audio, it's a very nice touch. The lighting may not be for everyone and can easily but disabled as well. One of the benefits of the larger form factor in this 18"" laptop, you can the added benefit of a numeric keypad, which can be great, especially if you do any sort of 3d work, like in Blender. The trackpad is also nice and large. It's smooth to use as well. The backlit RGB keyboard is also cool. Offering the same reactive color the bottom lighting does. The ports on offer are also a nice touch. Especially having an ethernet port built in. This just makes every aspect of gaming able to reach the best performance possible. The screen and audio are also standouts. the screen is nice and bright, it's also capable of some very high refresh rates (240hz), which is excellent when paired with some of the higher frames this laptop is capable of. Speakers are also much better than you may expect. They're rated for Dolby Atmos, and they sound great during use. Lots of clear highs and a surprising amount of bass. - Performance If you're looking for a top performing laptop, this is near the best you can get. I believe there is a model with an RTX 5090 as well, but I think the value for performance is probably better with the RTX 5080. The Intel Core Ultra 9 seems up to the task as well. Since the CPU is equally as important when it comes to gaming and other intensive tasks. I have been pushing this laptop pretty hard, and its performance has far exceeded my expectations. As far as gaming goes, I think Cyberpunk 2077 is still one of the games that pushes hardware to its limits. I tested both on the laptop screen itself, and outputting at 4K. Utilizing some of the new DLSS tech these 50 series cards are capable of, like frame generation I was getting very impressive numbers. I was able to get over 100 FPS at 4K with ray tracing and nearly everything maxed out. Using the laptop screen at 2560x1600, I was able to get well over 180 FPS. Other games are easily performing well at maximum settings. Maxing out Forza Motorsport, with all raytracing, I was able to get 60FPS, and this is without utilizing DLSS at all. Enabling DLSS, I was able to push the framerate much higher. If I made a few extra tweaks, it would be fairly easy to get 120 FPS. The fans weren't too overpowering either, even when being pushed too hard. They are noticeable, of course, but not as loud as other gaming laptops that I have used. One final note, on the battery life. When not gaming, and not pushing that Nvidia card, the laptop can get some reasonable battery life. However, like any other gaming laptop, when being pushed hard, you're likely to need to keep the charger handy. I was getting a little under 2 hours during some gaming sessions. I do like the option to put the laptop in a battery health mode, that keeps its charge under 80% to help preserve the battery when it's being kept plugged in, which is what I often do. Using it for gaming while I'm home and plugged in, then take it with me on trips. If you're looking for a gaming laptop with no compromise, this is easy to recommend. Pros: Comfortable to use, nice build, excellent performance, great screen, clean sounding audio, lots of ports (including ethernet), excellent upgradeability with easy to open case. Cons: Battery life isn't always the greatest when gaming, even though it's a large (18"") laptop, I still wouldn't mind if there was room to shave off some of the size.",5,2025-05-09
Bappy,The Gozilla of gaming laptops,"ASUS and their Republic of Gamers (ROG) line of gaming PCs continues a great run in 2025. This year I acquired the new Strix G18 gaming laptop. Physically this is like a boat anchor, there is no effort to make this lightweight or portable. Sure, if you are going to a meetup or a friend’s house then you can throw this in a well-protected backpack and take it with you. Don’t forget the power supply, yea this thing has a battery – but you don’t want to rely on it. Ergonomically the Strix G18 is substantial, weighing in at over 7lbs, all in a plastic case. Although the case is well designed it almost screams for a more premium chassis to match the class of components in this system. A supple keyboard with keypad, lighting the gaming keys and spacebar with a large trackpad. There are dedicated keys for volume up, volume down, mute, power and a button to invoke the Armoury Crate software. Armoury Crate is ASUS’ software which provides you with deep insight and tuning abilities primarily with a CPU and GPU focus. Several preset modes are provided to keep all the performance related black magic behind the scenes. Performance profiles include Windows, Silent, Performance, Turbo (AC Powered only) and a Manual preset. Be aware of some the enhanced performance modes overclock the CPU/GPU and can really raise the temperature testing the limits of cooling on this system, the fans will definitely scroll up with high GPU and CPU utilization. In any case the 18 inch 2.5k IPS ‘Non’ touch IPS screen with a 16:10 aspect radio. The display is bright with some bleed through in dark scenes, but this screen will light up the room if necessary. The NVIDIA RTX 5080 GPU w/16GB of GDDR7 memory is the star of the show here, this model is paired with an Intel Core Ultra 9 Series 2 CPU, this is a pair made in heaven as this notebook performs. The CPU cruises normally at about 2.7GHz it will amp up to 5.1GHz, blazing those 8 performance centered cores with 16 efficient cores. Of course, this calls for some advanced temperature cooling and ASUS uses Tri fan technology matched with something branded as “Conductonaut Extreme” (which sounds like a metal band). I will avoid diving too deeply into gaming performance, I only play a few games, but those I do play including ACE Combat 7 and the more demanding Starfield, looked silky smooth with no dropped frames or glitches. I maxed out at about 80fps on Starfield @ 4k. In general this system performed flawlessly with high frame rate games. Although the Nvidia 5080 GPU really shines performance wise, I had some issues with the latest Nvidia Studio drivers and had to revert back to a version which was on the ASUS support site. This is the second instance of installing drivers from the Nvidia app caused stability issues (in this case external monitors not waking from sleep mode or Windows Hello responding). So as always is the case with video drivers, they evolve and improve, so looking forward to a newer stable version of those drivers so I can move to a normal update channel from Nvidia. Ports and Expandability: on the sides of this notebook are two Thunderbolt 5 ports with support for DisplayPort, power delivery and G-SYNC. An HDMI 2.1 port, Three 3.2 Gen 2 USB-A ports, a 2.5gbps ethernet port on this system and a headphone jack. Wi-Fi 7 compatibility when paired with a Wi-Fi 7 router, especially one with a 6GHz radio reach almost gigabit speeds. There is no SD or Mini SD card reader. Overall, system performance is Steller and this is the fastest Windows laptop I have ever used. Easily handling demanding and high frame rate games to sync up with the 240hz IPS panel. Performs well for gaming or content creation, the appearance is unique, components are high spec and perform well. Another use case for this class performance notebook (or portable workstation) is being a key component in creating content – including moderately advanced video editing. Performance in Davinci Resolve Studio was vastly improved over my ASUS Zephyrus gaming notebook. This may be a high-performance laptop targeting gamers, however since video editing stresses some of the same computing components (CPU and GPU) as gaming, this also makes for a premium, high end video editing rig. Edit screens and functions within Davinci Resolve worked flawlessly, rendering blazingly fast. No need to reduce a 4k timeline to HD for editing, the Strix handles the workload with ease. No struggles with live previews, timeline refreshes, special effects, fusion components or other GPU intensive activities. Pros: - Large form factor - Performance oriented, blazing quick CPU and GPU - Ports: two Thunderbolt 5 ports, HDMI 2.1 port, Three 3.2 Gen 2 USB-A ports, a 2.5gbps ethernet port on this system and a headphone jack. - Bright 18 inch 16:10 2.5k IPS non touch screen – high refresh rate - IR Camera built in, provides you the ability to leverage facial recognition for biometric based logins with Windows Hello. - Easy remove back panel for access to Memory and SSD slots. Cons: - Given this is a gaming laptop, a larger capacity SSD and more RAM is needed right out of the box for even better performance.",5,2025-05-16
456SG,I Gotta Say….,"First thing I want to point out, overheating does not happen. When I was using it for video editing and gaming, it only went up to 50-65c. The cooling fans actually help a lot. Second, glitching, coil whine, BIOS update failure, etc. None of that exist in the product. It is actually pretty useful, just using it make me forget the time of days. However the only thing I hope is that if it has an RGB logos at the back monitor, that would be the best design. Doesn’t have to be like Scars.",4,2025-07-31
David,Power house but mine came with QC issue,"Honestly this is an amazing laptop with amazing specs. Runs everything you throw at it with max settings!! Keyboard felt good, display was good all well rounded. Unfortunately mine came with a design flaw where the wrist rest area was sharp and cutting into my arm. I wish I could’ve kept it but having QC issues like that is unacceptable at this price point.",3,2025-06-16

DAVIDB,My ASUS - ROG Strix G18 is a Photoshop powerhouse,"I purchased my ASUS - ROG Strix G18 at Best Buy after reviewing a few laptops as candidates suited for speeding up Photoshop editing of photos and videos. The ASUS G18 offered unusual technical muscles for that role and the 18 inch screen promised to provide a terrific view on work. I'm not a gamer, so had hesitated to pay for flashy features I do not use, but the core strengths of this machine have proven it to be the top choice. I have been impressed, now that I'm putting it to full use, with how it goes beyond expectations. I feel it is cutting my Photoshop machine wait time in half.",5,2025-07-24
Tron,ASUS Strix G815 Open box,"Good laptop for the price and specs, although armory crate can cause some issues. Not recommended if youre frequently traveling. IPS screen is nice, short battery life. The quick release/tool-less bottom panel for easy access to upgrading is a great feature. ASUS support is such a tedious hassle though. Purchased open box and tried to register the laptop via ASUS, spent 2 weeks going back and forth with support until they finally managed to register it to my account... except it was missing a couple months of warranty (due to when the previous owner registered it). Nor did I receive any points/credits for registering via ASUS ROG.",4,2025-07-16
nautec,"Large laptop, large value","The Asus ROG Strix G18 laptop is a great gaming laptop that has all the specs and features to be a daily gamer. Asus has two lines of ROG gaming laptops: Strix and Zephyrus. Both contain all the latest NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5000 series video cards and the latest Intel Core Ultra processors. The main difference is the thinness of each laptop. The Zephyrus is nice and thin but suffers from one major annoyance, heat. Because of how thin it is, the moving of air to keep the laptop cool is not as possible as the Strix series. Since it’s a bit thicker, the fans are bigger and allow more air to be pushed so the laptop stays cooler during heavy gaming. The 18” screen is great for gaming because of how much real estate is possible to see the entire scene of the game. It may not be the latest OLED screen, but most people would not know the difference. Colors and brightness are no problem with this display. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 is whisper quiet thanks to the innovative airflow built into the laptop. Games run smoothly and graphic intensive applications such as video editing and 3D modeling run without a hiccup. Call of Duty, no problem. Marvel Rivals, no problem. Adobe Premiere, no problem. Asus has built into the computer a lot of quality-of-life improvements such as a row of quick access buttons to set fan speeds, brightness, mouse pad lock, and LED lighting. If you are looking for a large gaming laptop, you can’t go wrong with this laptop.",5,2025-05-30
Vahid,Cheaply made,"I have to say I was excited to get this laptop. It has great specs and the screen looks good. At least according to what i read online but after I received it, i was disappointed because the build quality is bad. It is all made out of plastic for a laptop that is over $3000 i was expecting something else. I know it is 18” laptop amd its big and heavy but its not great. Also the RGB lights started flickering after a few hours and the fan was working really hard and I suspected it was caused by overheating which was also disappointing. I ended up returning it and purchased HP Omen which has aluminum chassis and better build quality",1,2025-04-29
PeterM,Fast with cool RGB,This laptop would have a perfect 5/5 star review if the ports didnt feel loose. Other than that this laptop is the perfect desktop replacement paired with a external monitor if you want home performance as well as mobility. Its able to play 4k games with an external monitor at 100 fps and 2k games at 160+ fps. I recommend buying an external laptop cooler if you want longevity for your gaming investment. The ASUS software to control the RGB and settings is very premium and highly customizable. You'll get lost just playing with the settings and staring at the lights lol. No... seriously the RGB is like a light show at a rave.,4,2025-06-09
VoIPTeK,Good but had defective unit,"I purchased this to replace my ""Alienware - Area 51M R2 Laptop - FHD- 300Hz- Intel Core i7 - NVIDIA RTX 2070 SUPER, 32GB RAM"" spec gaming laptop. Although it has a i7-10700K desktp CPU in it, it requires two power supplies and the main 360Watt is massive. So I was happy to see not only did this one have one single power supply, but it was smaller than the main power supply of my other laptop. I saw someone say they thought this power supply was massive but compared to the previous two Alienware laptops, this is a great size for the amount of power it provides. Setting this up for the first time out of box took about 45 minutes or so to get all the updates. There were mutiple bios updates from Asus as well. However those were painless as it was pretty much automatic. Other systems I'd have to put it on a USB to install it but the bios updates on this machine were as easy as a windows update. I did a lot of testing with Forza Motorsport, Forza Horizon 5, Ratchet and Clank, and many others. The LCD panel has amazing color accuracy. Sure, you don't get the dark blacks like an OLED or mini-LCD, but it is an excellent screen none-the-less. The ray-tracing worked well. As a casual gamer, I still haven't found the need for it but is definitly cool to see when you can crank it up and still have smooth performance. However, that is where the first issue came in. Although you can run high leel of ray tracing settings, I would get glitches in many games. I would say maybe once every 5 to 10 mintues my character in Ratchet and Clank for example would turn into a series of vertical lines briefly then return to normal. In Forza the exact same effect would happen on some trees in the distance. Not bad enough to return, but definitly not something you'd expect for the cost. I can have lower settings on the 2070 super notebook without those issues. The performance was great, the screen was great, and aside from a few glitches, I was happy. But then I tried to test VR games with a wired link using the thunderbolt ports with the Meta Quest 3. That's when I found any device I connect would only work in USB 2.0 compatiabilty mode. Therefore, it was too slow to play any PC VR games. I tried hooking up my thunderbolt USB-C NAS drive to it, and same thing happened; I could only get about 370mb/sec. When I went into the BIOS, there is a USB test feature. With the Quest 3 connected, it showed it supported USB 3.0 but was operating on USB 2.0. No matter what settings I adjusted in Windows for power, and any USB settings I could find, nothing I connected would operate higher than USB 2.0. When I went to support, they wanted me to send it in for an RMA. That shouldn't happen after less than 24 hours with the system. :) That is the primary reason I returned it. The other thing I didn't like, but not a resason to return it, was the RGB keyboard. There is not really a plain white solution. It has a blue hue to it which doesn't show up in the photo. The WASD area and space bar I think they tried to make unique from the other keys but to me just looks odd. My alienware laptop has a per key RGB and has a clean white if you so choose. I mostly had the RGB off except for the off-white keyboard to see in the dark but even that, if you reboot or do anything, it lights up like a christmas tree with the rainbow effect which would be nice to keep off if you have them off in the settings all the time. Overall for the price, I think it's good. It's about $600 more than the last Alienware laptop I got when it was new. You can order a custom build to this on Dell and is still a few hundred dollars more so I think if you're ok with the keyboard RGB limitations and don't have a defective unit, this laptop has a lot of potential. I think though this may be one of those things where eveyrthing is still new and may be better waiting until a 5080ti type model comes out.",3,2025-05-05
Lorenzo,A really solid performer but with some drawbacks,"I started my journey with this laptop a little week ago. Here are my overall thoughts on this “desktop replacement” The unboxing is quite the experience. This “laptop” is a massive beast and you go through a mix of emotions. Heavy and thick and the charging brick reminds you of exactly that, a brick! You instantly realize this is a unit you won’t be taking to Starbucks for a long writing session but you know this unit is about to blow you socks off when it comes to performance. It’s plastic but feels incredibly solid. Screen easily opens up and you are greeted with its ginormous Keybed and trackpad with not much flair other than some Rog branding that is tasteful. Once you fire it up you are greeted with a lovely intro and the RGB light show roars to life. The underglow would make bin diesel proud. Setup is the standard windows experience and a few hours of updates and restarts are a must before you can dive in. Once you go through all the updates it’s finally time to see what this bad boy can do. I’m a tinkerer and I am a sucker for tuning and running benchmarks. That cinebench 23 score is a sight to see. My 275hx after tuning is scoring 37633 which is just insane for a “laptop”. Gpu benchmarks left my jaw dropped. I watched 3 1/2 year old precious desktop build get destroyed over and over. This guy is not only shaped like a tank, but it’s an absolute beast under the hood. Gaming is an absolute dream hands down. This laptop PERFORMS! I instantly knew it was time to upgrade my unit with a fresh 4tb nvme. Opening the back of the laptop was insanely easy. Just slide a simply lever and the backside frees right up greeting you with 2 nvme bays (one is occupied) and upgradable ram slots. The nvme I installed took a bit of time because the built in plastic clip that turns to hold the drive down (no screw needed) and I was honestly scared I was going to snap it because it took a lot of force to turn by hand. After working it back and forth it feels like it probably should. Snug and holds the drive perfectly. Call me crazy but a simple tiny screw holding the drive down would have been easier at least on my unit. Keyboard and trackpad are excellent. This is no MacBook in build quality, but everything functions as it should and the trackpad is usable enough that I wasn’t instantly searching for my external mouse while navigating windows. Now on to the mid part of this laptop. Its screen has some light bleed in gray scenes but thankfully it’s not viewable in all content. Its colors are vibrant and really solid for an IPS panel. Just know this screen is definitely not going to win any awards. It’s perfect for gaming and accurate enough for content creation, but watching movies is going to be a letdown compared to what most of us have in our living rooms. This is a far cry from an OLED or mini LED but it is “good enough” The speakers are also not going to win any awards. They state it’s a 4 speaker system but the tweeters under the screen (small slits in the laptop hinge) on the front of the laptop don’t do much. You mainly hear the downward firing speakers and they are pretty midrange focused. Some dialing in via the Dolby access app solved some of these issues as I found the 500k and 2-4k ranges were boosted far too much and it caused ear fatigue with pretty much any content. Don’t be expecting much bass below 150hz. Everything is loud enough to hear over the fans when they ramp up, but headphones would definitely be ideal. Battery life is pretty much a joke but I guess it’s usable in a pinch. 3-4 hours doing light work with the GPU disabled. Maybe an hour in a light game with restricted settings. Short summary- Yes you are paying for the internals and they perform at a high level! Just be aware that there is some drawbacks to a device like this. Yes, it’s portable in theory, however I don’t see my unit being taken anywhere other than to a buddy’s house for a rare gaming session. This isn’t really travel friendly and the battery life isn’t great and that charging brick needs to be tethered. The screen and speakers and plastic build all work fine and are usable, but you realize these 3 areas are where the cutbacks happened. All in all if you plan to buy this unit, know what you are getting. This isn’t really a laptop. It’s definitely in the desktop replacement class and if you go into this unit understanding that then you will be happy. It’s a beast of a gaming pc and the specs and performance are enough to make your desktop collect dust. Final thoughts- wait for a sale if you can. Yes you get a lot for the msrp, but there are enough drawbacks that I don’t feel it’s worth it at full price when the market is saturated with several respectable competitors.",4,2025-09-01

JaysCreations,Great Workstation for Design & Gaming,"Overall, from start to finish the set up and use has been incredible. I’ve been using this laptop for all my work programs and it handles everything without a hitch. Performance is smooth and reliable. Battery life is decent, but I wouldn’t recommend running heavy tasks unless you’re plugged in and using the main GPU. I tested it with RUST on a 600-player server, max settings, and it stayed at around 100 FPS. Since RUST is a CPU-heavy game, that’s pretty impressive, though your results may vary depending on the game or workload. The screen is sharp and clean, with no backlight bleed that I’ve noticed. The top metal surface feels really smooth and comfortable for typing. The touchpad is pretty sensitive, but I use an external mouse so it’s not an issue for me. This is a strong choice for anyone who needs a reliable work laptop that can also handle gaming. I’m confident it’ll stay solid for years to come.",5,2025-05-18

CillianB,Great Laptop,"I got this as a desktop replacement, and it has more than handled everything i have thrown at it. Build quality is excellent. Didnt really have much bloat on it, just Amory Crate and thats not to bad to use, could be better I guess. I would have gotten the Stix Scar with a 5080 for the mini-led panel that I wish this had. As I could care less about all the extra RGB that isnt just keyboard. Overall i am very happy with this thing. It is indeed a beast and worth the extra $400 over the 4080 version for future proofing alone.",5,2025-04-14

BENJAMINL,Multiple exchanges same issues,"Had to return this twice for the same issues horrible popping/crackling audio to the point i couldn't hear anything updated all drivers and looked for any solution just no fix available brought my first one back had to have another shipped in from out of state got it in and had the exact same issue again tryed all the fixes I could think of but ultimately Ihad to swap it out for a different brand all together. Very disappointed i actually really liked the way this one looked, loved the bigger size and the graphics and features.",2,2025-07-25
Alonzo907,Great Buy,"I was a bit hesitant on purchasing this laptop, but after having it for a couple of weeks and putting it to use for work and gaming I am enjoying it very much. I thought it was going to be an issue with the monitor being bigger than my last laptop which was 16"" but this one does not disappoint. After loading all the apps for gaming and testing it out on Apex, Warzone, I am very happy with the choice I made. Was easy to install more memory as well, this laptop runs the games I play without any issues at all.",4,2025-08-28
ITJim,Outstanding Performer,"The ASUS ROG Strix G18 gaming laptop is a powerhouse for gaming. The G18 chewed through my favorite games like a hot knife threw butter. Its 3Dmark Time Spy benchmark score was 22,827. The Mobile 5080’s individual score was 21,815 while the Intel Ultra 9 275HX CPU score was 16,574. I keep reading reviews about how weak the Intel Ultra 9 is for gaming. Not only did this CPU bench well. It games well. Gaming: Mechwarrior Online, or MWO for short is a Direct X 9/11 game that is about 12 years old. It is also the game I play the most and am the most familiar with. There is No DLSS, no Ray Tracing, and no ALLM. Instead, this game is solidly in the class of system destroying, brute force, high horsepower graphics rendering that leverages TXAA anti-aliasing, Post-Processing, and, of course, max fidelity settings. Well, it was back in its day. At 2560x1600, the G18 completely owned MWO. FPS ranged from 130 to 90 with an average of around 100 FPS. In my experience, 130 is where this game tops out. Considering how poorly optimized this game is, 100 to 130 is perfect. Better yet, I was able to maintain this performance connected to my external 34” 1440 monitor. Next, Diablo IV. This game runs great at medium high settings with DLSS turned on. DLSS is fine when walking around a town. When bossing or in a tough fight, where timing is everything, then DLSS simply gets in the way, and in some cases, will get your character killed. With DLSS on, I was steady around 130 FPS. With DLSS off, the G18 was able to maintain a steady 100 or higher FPS. Graphics settings were set to medium-high with some Ray Tracing on. Finally, Call of Duty Black Ops 6. The first thing I did was run the built-in benchmark/calibration routine. I posted a screenshot so you can see all the numbers. The system scored 150 with DLSS on and 136 with DLSS off. For competitive play, turn DLSS off. It will save you a lot of frustration. Actual game play, the FPS hovered around 100 FPS. This was more than good enough to remain competitive. There was not screen tearing, no lag, and not ghosting on the screen. I actually had some of my best matches on the G18. That is, after I turned off DLSS. With DLSS on, I had some of my worst matches due to the lag or delay in real time, screen rendered information. Overall, less DLSS, my gaming experience was excellent. DLSS has its place. Just not in online competitive gaming. Fan Noise: The G18 has five power profile modes that directly impact system noise. Amory Crate has three pre-configured profiles: Silent, Performance, and Turbo. Amory Crate also has a mode that works directly with Windows Power Plan. Finally, there is the option to build your own power profile. Silent is exactly that. Fans are off. The system will get warm but not hot. Performance mode has a range from quiet to loud depending on system load. Energy consumption increases on the system. This in turn causes more heat which demands the fans run to keep the system cool. While gaming, the fans ramped up to about 80% to 90%. I would recommend a good pair of noise canceling headphones while gaming. Turbo mode is full peak system power, peak heat, and peak leaf blower fan performance. At 100%, the G18 fans are loud. Headphones with good noise isolation is required. The fans running at 100% does a good job of keeping up with the heat. But, the system will still heat up and you will run into CPU throttling. Overall, I feel that the Performance pre-set power profile is an excellent balance between energy consumption, heat management, and performance. Keyboard and RGB lighting: The keyboard is well laid out, comfortable to type and game on, and the keys have a good resistance and return. The only thing I do not like about this keyboard are the translucent Q, W, E, R, A, S, D, F, and space bar keys. In a dark room, or a room with poor lighting, it is nearly impossible to read the silk screened letter on the key cap. I found this challenging in situations where I need to see the key. For example, I use a rare key function in one of my games and want to visually confirm before pressing the key. Not all my games are FPS games. This is not an issue in a well-lit room. The RGB, as a whole, is very well done. The letters, number, and words on the regular key caps are shine through. And each key cap allows light to purposely blead around the edges. The bottom of the G18 has four RGB light strips that can either coordinate with the keyboard RGB or act independent of the keyboard. I kept them on for a few days and then turned them off. The RGB strips are well done, well placed, and cast a lot of light. Asus provides a way to change RGB via some presets. It also provides the ability to turn the lighting off. One place where Asus seems to keep missing the mark is keyboard lighting customization. Aura Creator is a nice to have, assuming it will even detect your keyboard and chassis light bars, but it is insanely difficult to use to any effect. And tying custom profiles to games has always been a hit or miss exercise. Sound: The speakers are clear and good enough for laptop speakers. They won’t compete with a dedicated headset or dedicated external speakers. They are good enough for YouTube, pod casts, Netflix, internet radio, and other leisurely listening activities. While gaming, the fan noise will overwhelm the speaker audio quality. They are still useful for gaming. However, the competition with the fan noise will eventually force you into a headset. Screen Performance: I think Asus nailed it with the screen. Colors are bright and vibrant. The refresh rate at 240Hz is excellent. I did not notice any ghosting, artifacts, or screen tearing while gaming. Even the fast twitch movements associated with playing CoD6 was clean, fast, and completely immersive. The only thing that would make my experience better is upgrading the laptop’s screen to an OLED. Or connecting to an external OLED gaming monitor. Upgradability: I upgrade my laptops. Back in the day, laptops had doors and drawers to access hard drives, memory, CD players, and batteries. Today, everything has screws and plastic clamps which are time consuming, difficult to work with, and can often lead to scratches or other unintended damage. Thank you, thank you, thank you Asus for bringing “easy” back to user-accessible upgrades. The bottom cover has a latch that slides, clicks, and then the bottom cover simply slides off. It could not be any easier. Ram, battery, and SSD slots are easily accessible. The main board is protected by a secondary plastic cover. Final thoughts: This is a beast of a system. The system will get warm regardless of what power mode is selected. Under load, the system fans get loud. Gaming performance is excellent. Daily productivity is excellent. There are power saving features, such as CPU Core Configuration and nVidia Optimus, that will help make this laptop perfect as a workstation and gaming computer replacement. Overall, I am very happy with the G18. I think it is an excellent system.",5,2025-05-10
NightMARES,I don’t know,"First time gamer, haven’t played games in about 6-8 years. got this laptop so I can occupy some time when on the road traveling for work. I love it so far the quality is amazing graphics are really good. The only down fall that I seen and again I’m new here so I don’t know if this is normal, but the battery only lasted about an hour and a half while unplugged and watching Netflix. Not a big deal for me cause I’m going to have it plugged in at a desk anytime I use it. Other than that I love it so far!",5,2025-05-30
AidanM,Satisfied so far!,"I got this about 2 weeks ago and so far I have no issues or complaints. The cpu is extremely fast and my the gpu is a monster and my temps have stayed nice and cool. Only things I say could be better is 64GB of ram rather than 32. I could probably add another ram stick or two, but I’m not sure if it’s easily upgradable. The other thing I think could be better is if it had 4TB rather than 2TB but that’s not really an issue because I can easily add another 2TB or even more if needed.",5,2025-05-19
Anonymous reviewer,"It’s good, but..","Whenever I am about to play a game, a nvidis window pops up from right bottom corner, and laptop freezes for 4-5 seconds. Could not find a way to fix it. Honestly this is my first time using ASUS, I did not like that laptop is mostly plastic material. Makes it look like a low budget laptop. Maybe Scar series are better about. So If I had a chance I would buy some other laptop but can’t refund the laptop because I am leaving USA. I hope the warranty will be valid international.",4,2025-05-16
TSMi,Asus G18,"The first model of the laptop had to be returned because the pit stop or tool less function had a broken plastic SSD lock. No SSD upgrade was possible. Best Buy graciously accepted a return and ordered a new laptop. Very frustrating that a 25 cent piece of plastic toasted a laptop, The broken PC is the reason for the star downgrade. The new G18 works well; no quality issues. The new keyboard and touch pad layout takes getting used to but no big deal. I installed a 2TB SSD in the vacant slot which is an easy peasy process. I'm not a gamer but frequently use Lightroom and video editing software. The G18 rocks in those arenas. Love the monitor and the factory color balance was extremely close. A Datacolor Spyder color balance tuneup made minimal change. No battery review since it is always plugged in. So far no issues.",4,2025-07-18
DOMINIQUEJ,Best Gaming Laptop I've Had,"I absolutely love this laptop, it's so much better than my previous ASUS gaming laptop. I love the RGB lighting and I didn't know it would go full around the laptop as I had only seen online reviews and didn't see the laptop in person. It runs very smooth and provides me enough storage to do all the things I want. I love that you can also upgrade the storage. I'm still learning so much about the laptop and I don't regret the purchase at all!",5,2025-07-25

Jcarden8,This is the Laptop you’re looking for,"I love this laptop. No complaints. I know people will complain about the weight or how hot the computer gets. Its a laptop with an intel and monster hardware of course it’s going to get hot depending on various factors. For small activities such as, surfing the internet or doing homework it doesn’t get hot for me. I use this more for gaming, I do have it on a cooling pad and it doesn’t get hot unless I play a quality hungry game at max settings like Cyberpunk. I did get this laptop on sale thats why I ending up grabbing it at my local BB for a steal of a deal. If you do buy this laptop (or any ASUS gaming laptop) I recommend you to delete Asus armoury crate and it’s sister applications to download G helper instead. The best program to have on these gaming asus laptops. If you can find this product for a deal or if you have the money to spend I say get this laptop for sure.",5,2025-06-13
ArashE,Strix G18: Powerhouse Performance,"The Strix G18 stands out with its massive 18-inch display and strong all-around performance, rivaling even higher-priced laptops equipped with the RTX 5090. It’s not just about raw power either — the 240Hz refresh rate ensures buttery-smooth gameplay, and the keyboard offers a tactile, responsive feel that’s great for both gaming and productivity. Battery life surpasses expectations for a machine of this size and caliber, and thermal performance remains stable even under heavy load, thanks to an effective cooling system. The build quality is solid, and while the design leans toward the gamer aesthetic, it maintains a relatively clean and mature look. At over 18 inches, this isn't a laptop meant to be carried around all day — but for those looking for a desktop-class experience in a portable form, the Strix G18 delivers exceptional value without the price tag of flagship models.",5,2025-08-01
IvyK,Display & Overall Experience,"Wow. Just, wow. The ASUS ROG Strix SCAR 18 delivers an unparalleled laptop experience.

DennisK,I'm satisfied.,"Was looking for a replacement for my ASUS ROG Flow Z13. Years go by and I'm not young anymore.

Carlos,The Most Powerful Gaming Machine I Have Owned,"I have been a console gamer for the longest until I got the Rog Ally Z1E. The Ally was the push that I needed to get converted into PC gaming. I needed something that would be easily moveable within my home, so a desktop was not an option for me. I wanted power and a laptop that will be used for gaming. The Zephyrus line was nice, I didn’t really check out the TUF line, the Scar was out of my budget so I went with an Open Box Strix G line. This G18 with 5080 was more than enough and should last me for years to come. It played every game I tested better than my Series X. I got tired of paying for online, so I’m so happy PC gaming offers free online play. The 2tb is very nice but I’m planning to install another 2tb. The best part is how easily I could open up this laptop and install upgrades. I feel very fortunate to be able to acquire this powerful gaming laptop. I believe I made the best decision in getting this model. It is a banger!",5,2025-08-14
BobWCheese,"Heavy powerhouse, too many lights","A little on the heavy Side. A lot of power and heat. It will take some getting used to.

I still haven't been able to figure out how to turn off the strip lights.",4,2025-08-02

Keith,Good Gaming Laptop but…,"I tested this laptop out for a few weeks and I have to say that the 18 inch screen is amazing. You can tell the difference between this and a OLED screen when it comes to color clearly in OLED screen pops, but this screen does a good job of displaying the colors and have an 18 inches of real estate to game on as a plus. Another feature I liked is the face recognition to unlock the laptop. I will say I tried playing a game like Fortnite on all three modes, silent performance and turbo, and the first thing I noticed was that it doesn’t truly handle the FPS as well as it should once it starts ramping up. This thing gets very loud (fan noise) in performance and turbo mode and after a couple games, your FPS starts to drop even in performance the most I could get was about 130 FPS, which is still decent but this thing should be pushing close to 200. Overall I think this is a great laptop I just think that the price doesn’t justify the performance. I do think that out of the 18 inch displays that are available right now, this is the best.

RockWood,"Multiple buying attempts, all freezing issues","I have attempted to purchase 3 of these ROG Strix 18"" laptops since February. Every single one of them had freezing issues. I am a system builder, and I know my way around Windows, drivers, updates, SSDs, ect. I know Asus machines very well. My 5 year old gaming Asus ROG machine is still running to this day. I don't know WHAT is going on with these machines, but they are NOT ready for release. The first one I bought had faulty wiring in it, and the backlit keyboard would not work. The second and third ones worked fine for a couple of days, and then started freezing. No Blue Screen of Death. Straight up, freezing. Everything would just lock up. No mouse movements, no keyboard response, nothing. I needed to hold down the power button for a hard reset. Afterward, it would boot up normally, and moments after it would totally freeze again. The LED light next to the charging port would just rapidly flash a while color. I had all the latest Windows Updates, I had all the latest BIOS and drivers from the My Asus app. This happened on 2 machines in the span of 3 days. These are not ready for release, and with the amount of software and licenses I have to assign to my machines and what not, this is unacceptable. At this price point, these things should be 1000% flawless right out of the box. I will not buy another Asus laptop again. This has been by fat the worse computer experience I have ever had. And I am a 25 year system builder. It's a shame, because specs wise these are impressive. Nothing but issues with them. It very well could be BIOS or driver update related. Some of us are trying to run businesses with these machines, and we just don't have time to deal with this garbage.",1,2025-05-12
Ghostly,Gaming Laptop,"Second laptop First one had a bad USB port. Fast laptop. Ive not used my ethernet cable at all. Simply running on my wifi. Gaming is smooth and fast. I do not understand the armor crate software at all. And it does not come with an instruction manual. I do love the aura affects and system adjustments. But if you haven't owned a laptop like myself. Your in for a learning curve. Many of the keyboard adjustments are not well indicated, nor understood by just looking at them. I think it needs a manual. Looking on YouTube for help is ridiculous. One dislike is the placement of the thumbpad placement. I'm left handed and had to shut the thumbpad off. I use a mouse and your left hand will mess with game interactions, with your left hand resting on the thumbpad It could be smaller or centered for left or right handed people. This does need to be fixed. They obviously did not take left handed people into consideration when they developed the placement on the thumbpad! Another issue i have encountered is the aura shutting off while gaming. This is a pain since it also lights rhe keyboard. Gaming in a dimly lit room becomes very difficult! If you close the lid and open it, it will come back, but close some programs your using, like discord. Again gotta do a YouTube search on that issue. I'm an older gamer, and not as tec savvy as younger folks. So figuring things out is not as easy. Coming from a very old desktop to this is unreal. Fast processor, amazing graphics, lots of storage. I have to go thru chemo sessions, which are 7hrs long, so this is going to come in very handy!!! Laptop cases for this system are limited, due to the large size of the system. But thats ok, they can be found.",5,2025-07-11
ShanGus,Performance - by the pound!,"To reiterate the title - for every ounce of weight of this laptop (omg is it heavy), you will get top rated gaming performance. I guess if you're into weighted blankets, you would want this on your lap while in use. Other than that, some other downsides: -You're going to want to plug this in unless you're gaming for only like an hour at a time -Fan noise can get high -Puts off some heat I loaded up Elder Scrolls Oblivion Remastered from XBox GamePass as I heard it is a machine crippler - I don't think I've ever seen such a beautiful game delivered without any sort of performance hit in the least. The visuals were great, though some may want to try to make the blacks 'blacker'. Absolutely no tearing of any kind. Sound was great for a laptop, though I'd suspect most gamers would be wielding headsets anyway. In the same vain, the touchpad - which worked as expected - is not something I would ever use while gaming - it just seemed to take up more space than needed. I hooked up an XBox game controller via Bluetooth without any issues. Lots of hard drive space to fill up with games. Lots of customization options with the built in Asus apps. If you're into LEDs, there's loads of them. I liked the treatment of them for the AWSD keys which are normally used for movement. The one 'gimmick' I wasn't a huge fan of was the laser light show the laptop generated while sitting idle. I just haven't taken the time to see if that was a thing I could disable. Other than that, the laptop looks great in general. Other highlights: -Ethernet port -Charging cord length was good, though the power brick - again - heavy/big. -Tool-less entry was a little fiddly but once you get it, it is nice, though I don't know what I'd be doing inside this machine anytime soon",5,2025-05-09

Hom3townH3ro,What a machine!,"WOW. I wish I could write this review and just leave it there. I have had other high end gaming laptops in the past but never have I been this blown away by the performance, versatility, look, and feel of one of these machines. First off, the unboxing and packaging. The box that this unit arrived in was just a cool presentation as it lifted the laptop up slightly when opened giving the vibe of premium right out of the gate. Not much included in the box, small instruction and warranty paperwork, the charger, and the laptop itself and you're set. The physical feel of this machine just screams premium. The materials feel nice and at 18"" on the screen it's large. I do not intend to do much travelling with this and rather mostly treat it like a desktop that takes up way less space, but if you did want to travel with it, you need a large and sturdy bag. The keyboard is of course RGB backlit and there is even lighting around the bottom to give it that ""gamer"" look. Booting up, setting up, etc was very quick. It's very fast, but standard windows setup. Immediately moved into downloading some games from the Xbox PC app (I have Gamepass, highly recommend) and getting Steam going. I've tried a few things from indie titles that are not very intense up to the latest releases and some free to play titles. Everything I have tried has run very smoothly and looked very impressive whether I used the built in monitor or hooked up to my normal docking station. Speaking of docking, The setup to connect to my triple monitor, gaming keyboard and mouse, external webcam and mic docking station was absolutely seamless. I've even done a bit of twitch streaming on this system and had no issues. Overall, this unit carries an premium price tag and it delivers. As the PC gaming industry trends more towards portability and ease of use with products like this as well as handheld options like the Steamdeck and upcoming Xbox branded ROG Ally, this premium price point delivers on everything I can think of or could want from a high end gaming laptop. If it's in your budget, this is the one to get.",5,2025-05-09
Dontech,What a beast of a gaming laptop,"The ASUS - ROG Strix G18 18"" 2.5K 240Hz Gaming Laptop - Intel Core Ultra 9 HX - 32GB RAM - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 - 2TB SSD - Eclipse Gray is one beast of a laptop! This ROG Strix G18 laptop comes well packaged as it should as the ROG Strix G18 is a heavy laptop indeed at just over 7lbs, as it needs to be with its stunning 18"" WQXGA and all the heat sink's inside to cool the system while in demand like playing games. The power supply brick that comes with the ROG Strix G18 is huge as it needs to be, especially plugged in during gameplay, that is required as this Asus laptop need the power to get you the best you can be visually and without lag. The setup went extremely easy and quick. The ROG Strix G18 comes with 3 months of pc game pass. The display is just a tad below OLED, meaning blacks are near perfect black. Colors are stunning, watching movies are stunning with perfect visuals. Playing games is just outstanding visually, also just perfect motion at playing games at 240htz. The display is perfect at everything and stunning! Pictures look stunning, movies look stunning, games look stunning. Viewing angles are great also. I just love having an 18"" high end display built in, basically no need for anything bigger. The sound this laptop produces is stunning for a laptop, certainly not high end sound system type (as expected) but certainly surprised on how great the speakers sound. Wifi 7 works great, super fast connection and definitely delivers on minimal lag in games, just like playing while plugged into Ethernet. The keyboard is just wow, you can set the color of your choice as the backlight. The keys feel great and placement of the keys is perfect. I love having a number pad. Playing games on the ROG Strix G18 is just wow, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 with the Intel Core Ultra 9 HX processor, this combo has so much power for present and future games. Playing games on this without any lag is just mind blowing. The response of the entire laptop and hearing the fans kick up when the 16 gigabytes of GPU ram of GDDR7 is used and you see and feel it while playing games, nice and smoothly as it should be. Asus just got everything perfect in syncing everything perfectly. You can max out all visualls in games and this Asus laptop just handles all aspects perfectly. I saw absolutely no studder, jitter or game lag. I was blown away at what games look like when you have all the power you need to get you to a point and beyond of stunning visuals and extremely smooth gameplay, that is extremely greatfull, so you have that advantage over others! You will not be disappointed! I am just blown away by this laptop!",5,2025-05-09
FlyingC,Laptop gaming beast!,"This laptop is a beast in the best possible way. Yes, it’s fairly expensive, but you get a beautiful, high-performance, portable gaming machine. In a nutshell, it runs cool, the fans are not too noisy, the graphics performance is top-notch, and the 18” monitor is beautiful. It is a little on the heavy side (a bit more than 7lbs) but it’s perfectly fine to haul to those occasional game nights with friends. At home, I typically use it with a Samsung 49” Odyssey Neo which it handles perfectly. My old gaming laptop would have some annoying stutter at times during lots of screen movement, but so far, the ASUS has been butter smooth for me. But if you don’t have or want to mess with an external monitor, the 18” monitor on the laptop is perfectly fine. It was easy to get set up initially. After the Windows updates were done, I started installing games via Microsoft Xbox. There are some useful ASUS utilities for system performance, graphics, etc. but very little in the way of annoying bloatware like on some computers these days. The 2TB drive gives me plenty of room, so I’m not worried about having to expand any time soon. You can read all the specs and other details of the system, so I won’t go into that, but here are some features I like. The RGB lightbar that outlines the underneath side of the laptop is a nice touch. It’s not something that would have influenced my purchasing decision, but now that I have it, I really like it. The chamfered edges of the laptop are a nice touch, too, and it makes the laptop seem a little sleeker. My favorite feature, though, is the tool-less access to the RAM, SSD, and fans on the back. I don’t know why every system made from now on would NOT have this kind of simple access. Not that I’m going to be messing with the RAM and SSD all the time, but it will be nice to be able to make sure the fans are staying clean. I do have cats that like to lay around near the computers, so this is going to be great for keeping the air flow clean. Speaking of the fans and airflow, another nice design feature is the hot air is vented out the back and not to the sides. So many laptops over the years would blow hot air out the side right onto your mouse hand, which I found annoying. With this laptop, the intakes are on the side and the vents are on the rear. One small detail that would have been nice is a power connector that was a 90-degree elbow instead of straight out. The power cord does stick out quite a way on the left side and my only concern is about bumping it or possibly smashing it into something. If it had a 90-degree turn, then it would be a sleeker fit and could route towards the back. Having said that, when I’m using it with an HDMI cable plugged in, then they’re both sticking out about the same, so it doesn’t matter as much. Overall, I’m super impressed with gaming on this computer. I feel like it’s top-of-the-line enough that it’s going to continue running my games for years to come. If this type of machine is within your budget, I think you’ll be very happy with the ASUS ROG Strix G18.",5,2025-05-09
TremoloCRR,One Month Honest Review,"Please read this before buying. No proper reviews are out yet, not even on YouTube, so I’m sharing everything I found, including two big issues that many older models had: backlight bleeding and improper liquid metal application. 1. Display – Backlight Bleed? Nope. Some people said this laptop has backlight bleeding issues, but mine didn’t have any. In fact, none of my friends who bought the same laptop had this issue either. The screen is honestly majestic – it’s huge, super smooth, and bright. No complaints at all. 2. Fan Noise & Thermals – Not Bad at All In Performance mode, fans do get a bit loud, but if you wear headphones, you won’t even notice. Turbo mode makes it louder, but I personally didn’t see any major FPS gains from it, so I just stick to Performance mode. Surprisingly, the laptop doesn’t heat up much, even after long gaming sessions. I’d recommend tilting it slightly using the power brick or a stand to help with airflow underneath. 3. Keyboard & Trackpad – Smooth Experience Trackpad is massive – feels great to use. Keyboard’s solid – no flex, no rattles, just smooth and responsive typing/gaming. 4. Battery – Don’t Expect Much If you’re planning to game on battery… don’t. I got around 1 to 1.5 hours max while gaming. This laptop is built to be used while plugged in, simple as that. 5. Gaming Performance – Rock Solid Every game I tested gave minimum 60-80 FPS on Silent Mode (with Very High to Ultra settings, plus ray tracing and path tracing with dlss set to quality). With Performance Mode, I was getting around 120-130 FPS on the same settings. And yes, I played on native resolution, which is 2.5k. Games I tested: Cyberpunk 2077 Elden Ring God of War (2018) Sekiro Red Dead Redemption 2 Expedition 33 Spider-Man Remastered (2022) I mostly use Silent Mode, which gives me super quiet gameplay and smooth 70 FPS. Honestly, that's more than enough for me. 6. GPU Issues? Initially, Yes – But Now Fixed When I first got the laptop, I faced: Screen flickering Black screen after sleep Laptop not waking up properly after heavy gaming After updating all the drivers (especially the GPU ones), everything works perfectly now. Also, Intel GPU drivers aren’t installed from factory, so make sure you download those manually if you want to switch to iGPU when using battery. 7. Hinges – Tight & Solid The hinge feels very sturdy. No wobble or looseness. Feels premium and long-lasting. 8. Liquid Metal Application – No Issues for Me One major issue people mentioned with older models was bad liquid metal application, but my unit seems fine. How to check? Run Cinebench R23 and see your CPU score. I ran it on Turbo mode (default settings), and got 35,900. As long as you're getting between 35,000 to 36,000, your liquid metal is probably applied correctly. 9. RGB & Looks – Chef’s Kiss The RGB is just beautiful. Especially the underglow around the bottom chassis – looks insane in low light. Feels like a proper ROG beast. 10. Misc Some people recommend undervolting it. But I’m on stock settings and haven’t felt the need. So it's up to you. There is no need for overclocking. This thing’s already powerful enough.",5,2025-05-09
Ebonovic,Near Perfect BEAST!!!!,"This is not the daily commuter, student laptop, or just to Netflix and chill. This is for the hardcore gamer, developer, video editor, or designer (or all of the above). Perfect for those that are tight on space or need to move around. I have been around technology a long time, this is one of the most powerful laptops I have ever used. While not the biggest, it is big compared to most laptops today, but it uses all of that space for good. This full 18"" monitor is GORGEOUS, detailed color, bright, just enough bezel to allow your eyes to stay focused on the screen for what ever you are doing. Sturdy and firm casing, you can feel it... this isn't flimsy, doesn't dip or tilt like some other large screen mobile devices. Full sized keyboard with number keypad... Great for a long list of reasons, a lot of laptops get rid of it... it's here and present. My first dislike, is the big oversized touchpad. I am not a fan of touchpads, especially large ones, that then take a lot of space at the bottom of the deck. Being a touch typist, for almost 40 years, it is a little awkward, but not crazy bad. There is just a lot of space.. .Bling it up with stickers :) RJ-45 hard line port, HDMI, and your standard USB assortment of ports. Now for my next negative... Power. The power brick is BIG!!! and heavy. I get it, this big computer needs the power. However, it has a custom power connector to the computer on the side. First would have loved it in the back, as the firm cord, jets out further to the left side, and then with its custom port.. can't readily get a replacement. Seems to be compatible with USB-C charging, but haven't tried pushing it. Thunderbolt ports are going to be really nice, to connect to large monitors. Only tried a single basic connection, worked great, was able to handle my wide screen, with no decline in image performance. It runs Windows out of the box, not going to review Windows, there are thousands of reviews out there. However, I will say that it took about 2 hours to get it all setup, software and hardware updates, and ready to go. Once setup though, here comes the performance. From a gaming point of view, I put it through the most recent Forza, and connected a XBOX controller to play. Racing and graphics was super smooth. The 5080 graphic card, did its job. The computer though didn't even seem like it was pushing itself. Fans were minimal. And the game play was great. no issues at all. From a design point of view, I fired up Adobe Suite, and was able to do my normal Illustrator usage and editing. The big screen was great, and I was able to send it over to my CNC machine and do its work. I don't do a lot of video editing, but did try it out, and full size videos were playing with no hiccups. Rendering some quick edits were fast, very little lag. Uploads to YouTube were quick on my WiFi, that clocked at over 600mps, but I was far from my WiFi7 access point, so this was on WiFi6. Lastly I fired up Visual Studio, to do some sample compiles, and it was great. I typically code on my Mac, but now with this, I will be able to use this Unreal or Unity development, as my Mac is tapping out on that. This is going to be a laptop I can use for a long time. Outstanding piece of equipment, looking forward to more title releases in 2025 and 2026, that can tap into all its power. So to recap: This really gets a 4.25 out of 5: Pros: - Big storage - Big Memory - Big Screen - Big Speed - Big Performance Con's - Custom and Large Power Brick - Big TouchPad and Big ""deck"" area",4,2025-05-15
Technopackrat,Maximum PWNAGE!,"I am always impressed how Asus keeps raising the bar, over and over and over! I've been a hug Asus fan for over a decade. I use their motherboards (Strix and TUF), video cards, power supplies and even some peripherals. When I need a laptop I've had a few other brands but always gravitate to Asus. Vivobooks are an awesome value for business or school but gaming laptops always push boundaries. I think my first gaming laptop was a G1 and everyone thought it was an AW. Stylish and powerful. What more do you need? I've settled in on Strix and Zephyrus laptops as my workhorse... for both work and play. The 16"" are luggable and great for work. Not too heavy or bulky and fit most laptop bags. The 18"" variants are more of a desktop replacement but even still, if determined, you can lug them just as easily but you need a spacious bag. The specs on this beast are amazing. Cram the Intel Ultra 9 HX into the case along with 32GB of replaceable DDR5-5600 SODIMM memory, a nVidia GeForce RTX5080 (mobile chip) and yes... finally a 2TB SSD. I was always stymied why manufacturers were stuffing 512GB or if lucky 1TB SSDs in a gaming laptop. Storage is key for a high performance gaming system... a lot of the AAA games take up gobs of space so the 2TB is welcome!!!! Even better is there is a spare NVME M.2 drive slot for an easy way to add to your storage. Back on memory for a second, the growing trend of soldering in at least one stick of RAM onto the motherboard is horrible and Asus doesn't bend to that practice, keeping with replaceable SODIMM sticks. While my previous Zephyrus G16 go scorching hot in the space between the keyboard and screen. That is not the case with this one. Cooling has gotten much better... more heat pipes that move the generated heat easily out of the shell. Pairing the RTX5080 with the 240Hz IPS display at 3ms response time gives you the awe-factor you look for in gaming. The 16:10 aspect ratio at 2560 x 1600 2.5K screen produces amazing clarity and 500 nits of brightness produces bright colors. Along with all the other hardware produces amazing frame rates and of course that depends on what game you are playing. Lots of RGB but glad it doesn't have the annoying lit slash on the lid that last year's Zephyrus had. Turned that off quickly! The keyboard has programmable RGB and I really love the translucent WASD-RF-Space keys. I use the numpad for work so the G18 gets me that with the extra real estate over the G16. Plenty of I/O ports that make connectivity a breeze. Left side you have power (rectangular connector instead of the usual barrel), ethernet, HDMI 2.1, USB-A 3.2, 2 Thunderbolt USB-Cs and headphone jack. On the right there are 2 USB-A 3.2. Wifi-7 provides the fast network connection needed when playing demanding games as long as your wifi system supports the faster speeds. Upgrading this system is a breeze. Gone are the bazillion case screens... okay... maybe 12 that you have to not lose and them grab the guitar picks and pry the bottom off. No sir, now it's a simple slide button on the bottom towards the front and once slid into the unlock position you slide the bottom forward and it's off. I personally don't see the need to upgrade the memory but you can definitely add that second NVME drive. For me... I tossed in a 4TB SSD and slid the bottom back on and the latch snapped to the locked position. Sound from the speakers is okay, could use a bit more bass for my liking but still more than adequate and nothing really to complain about. All in all bravo Asus. A well designed and beastly equipped machine.",5,2025-05-12
Marine778,This is a gaming monster!,"To do this review, I had my gamer son assist me in testing the Asus ROG Strix G18 and I wrote the review based on our mutual thoughts on the computer. I would consider myself average to somewhat advanced gamer, but my son is next level and is pretty gifted at gaming (and humbles me quicker than I care to admit). So, this is an honest review from someone that was extremely impressed with this computer and logged a lot of RPG hours in doing this review. When I look for a gaming computer, I want something that can pull it's weight. With tech always getting bigger, better and faster, it often comes down to a few brands and Asus is always a brand to look at first. The Asus ROG Strix G18 is more than just a strong performer, it feels like it was legitimately made with gamers in mind. Like taking feedback from the field and applying those considerations. It incorporates the top hardware, an advanced cooling system, a superior display, and a top-quality build. For me as a gamer/reviewer this is the best gaming computer I personally have had the chance to review. In this review I will focus on the Processor, GPU, cooling system, the display and build quality. I will then tell you why I like it so much. You can then decide if it would be a good option for you.  The heart of the G18 is the Intel Core i9-13980HX. The 24 core (not a typo) processor is among the most powerful processors on the market today. That includes 8 performance cores and 16 efficiency cores. Performance cores handle the demanding tasks and are faster, while the efficiency cores are just that, more efficient and handle the background tasks. For a gamer, this means more than simply high frame rates. It means you can multitask. Specifically, you can game, stream, record and/or browse with superior performance, without slowing your system down. I tested this playing a few different FPS games with the setting placed on high. I had various chrome tabs open, running OBS to stream and listening to some music. No stutters or any sort of delay what so ever, everything was smooth. Everything loaded quickly, background taskers were still responsive and demanding software runs smooth as silk. This kind of CPU performance is beneficial for gamers, as this core power makes sure your games never lag even with other programs running in the background. This computer will handle anything you throw at it.  For any gaming computer, the graphics card is going to maximize the experience, and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX series in the G18 is a powerhouse. These are some of the fastest mobile GPUs available, and they effectively revolutionized the gaming laptop. I tested the G18 with the RTX 4080 model, and the performance was spectacular! Again the FPS's ran smoothly on the ultra settings and it was better than anything else I have owed or tested to date on a laptop. If you prioritize frame rate, this GPU is for you. In the FPS games I tested, I was consistently pushing frame rates well over 200 FPS on the high settings, allowing me to enjoy that crisp 240Hz display. That smoothness can give you a competitive edge over others especially in the fast-moving FPS games where fractions of a second mean a lot. The RTX 40-series also supports something called hardware-accelerated ray tracing. This brings a more realistic look to the shadows, reflections and lighting.  So for a machine running this hard all the time, ASUS apparently understood it needed any equally high performing cooling system. So they utilize a three-fan cooling system with Conductonaut Extreme liquid metal on the CPU. This set up allows the ROG Strix G18 to run cool under the stress load.  I stress-tested the system with long gaming sessions, and I was surprised at how well it held up. Even after several hours of playing Starfield on ultra settings, the chassis remained comfortable to the touch and the system didn’t throttle performance due to overheating. For gamers, when a system gets too hot, it can affect the performance of your CPU or GPU to protect the hardware, which leads to lag and frame rate drops. With this advanced cooling system, the G18 delivers even performance when you are playing extended gaming sessions. The fans tend to kick in when needed, but they are extremely quiet and of zero distraction. ASUS also allows you to adjust performance and fan profiles using ""Armoury Crate,"" so you can go full send with the fans when you are gaming harder, or you can limit the fan use when you are doing lighter work.  This laptop features a rather large 18"" display. The QHD+ (2560x1600) Nebula display with a 240Hz refresh rate. That combo is perfect for anything from competitive gaming to watching a movie. The high resolution provides sharper images as you would expect. What I also learned was that it allows you to use more of your screen than when you compare it to the standard 1080p, Of course the high refresh rate ensures smooth motion while viewing or playing.  The color is another big plus. The panel supports 100% DCI-P3 color, making colors appear to me as more accurate. Blacks and shadows are deep and rich, and the highlights really stand out. When playing competitively, the combo of high frame rates and low latency creates a super responsive experience that can help improve gameplay.  The ROG Strix G18 is a large and heavy laptop, but that is because it is loaded with high end components. It has sharp lines highlighted by lighting. The thing just feels substantial and durable, like you would expect a really gaming machine to be. The keyboard is comfortable with a substantially deep press and the keys light up in a manner that does not affect your visibility of the keys with a nice key response. There are plenty of port options on the G18, with multiple USB-A and USB-C ports, HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, and a full-sized SD card slot. Again, another reason this laptop would be great for gamers and creators. The touchpad is large, and the large chassis leaves enough room for quality speakers that sound excellent.  This is not something that is designed to carry with you all the time, so its not exactly portable. But by far, this is the most portable laptop with the closest to desktop level performance that I have tried to date. But it is a bit heavy in that respect. Personally?  I will trade the weight for this level of performance.  So I spent a lot of time with the G18, and I have to say it impresses me a lot. Gamers demand certain things, and this hits all the marks. The processing performance and excellent choice for a GPU and an extremely smooth and responsive display. You pay for these options for sure, and there are cheaper options out there. But this is definitely an instance where you get what you pay for. Pull the trigger on this one folks, you won't regret it. I HIGHLY recommend this laptop to anyone wanting a superior gaming computer in a more compact form. Or any influencer wanting the ultimate platform to create their content. You will be happy with your decision.",5,2025-08-13
